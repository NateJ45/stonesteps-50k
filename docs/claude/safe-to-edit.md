# Safe to edit by hand (moved from CLAUDE.md)

Read before deciding whether a file can be edited casually. The counterpart list is `.claude/rules/foundation-files.md`.

These are the files where a project maintainer can make changes without risk of breaking the underlying architecture:

- Text content inside `src/pages/*.astro` (everything outside the frontmatter and Sanity-fetched content)
- `src/data/site.ts` -- static identity constants (site name, domain, brand color mirrors for scripts, asset paths). Replace all placeholder values before launch. (Written automatically by `npm run apply-brand`; also safe to edit by hand.)
- **The brand config (preferred reskin path):**
  - `brand/brand.config.json` -- single source of truth for identity, palette, fonts, and logo paths. Edit this, then run `npm run apply-brand` and it cascades to globals.css, site.ts, the Studio theme, and the OG image.
  - For a full rebrand orchestration (font install, brand apply, contrast check, copy retone) use the `/reskin` skill at `.claude/skills/reskin/SKILL.md`.
- The design seam -- files that define the visual identity of the project (also written by `apply-brand`; safe to edit directly if you know what you're changing):
  - `src/styles/globals.css` `@theme` block: palette tokens (`--color-primary`, `--color-ink`, `--color-paper`, etc.), the `--tint-rgb` token (controls polish-layer tint color across card-lift, surface-warm, and branded overlays), and font-family tokens
  - Font imports at the top of `src/styles/globals.css` (swap `@fontsource/libre-baskerville` and `@fontsource-variable/inter` for a project's chosen fonts; update `--font-display` and `--font-body` tokens accordingly)
  - `public/favicon.svg`, `public/og-default.png` (regenerate OG via `npm run og` after changing brand inputs in `scripts/generate-og-default.mjs`)
  - Logo files in `src/assets/` (imported by `Header.astro` / `Footer.astro` via `getImage()`)
- `src/data/defaultSections.ts` -- code-defined default section arrays for the section-driven core pages. These are the fallback content shown when no Sanity project is connected. Safe to edit as long as each object matches its schema type.
- Images in `src/assets/` (logo variants, OG image)
- Copy strings and `href` values in static page components
- Tailwind utility classes on existing components when content needs different visual weight
- Brand colors, tagline, and wordmark inputs in `scripts/generate-og-default.mjs` (re-run `npm run og` after editing)
- `docs/brand/voice.md` -- per-project voice and copy guidelines (fill in per project; the `/reskin` skill rewrites this during a full rebrand)

**Enabling the script accent (opt-in):** The calligraphic script accent is OFF by default. No script font loads unless you opt in. To enable it for a project: (1) add a `@fontsource` import for your chosen calligraphic face (e.g. `@fontsource/great-vibes/400.css`), and (2) update `--font-script` in the `@theme` block to name that face first. Components using the `font-script` utility class will then render the calligraphic accent.
