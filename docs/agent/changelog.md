_2026-09-06 — The starter catches up: Sanity phase 1, the family test standard, and two workflows harvested from the retiring church starter._

The starter had become the odd one out. It is structurally the canonical source (57 files carry the `PORTABLE` marker, PORTS.md has 44 cards, every client repo's `scripts/sync-check.mjs` diffs against it), but its stack and its gates were older than the sites it governs.

**A — Sanity phase 1** (PORTS card 10). `sanity` 6.4.0 to 6.9.1, `@sanity/vision` to 6.9.1, `@sanity/ui` 3.3.5 to 3.5.4, `@sanity/client` 7.23.0 to 7.26.2, `@sanity/visual-editing` 5.4.5 to 5.7.3 in both `dependencies` and `overrides` (npm refuses the whole install with EOVERRIDE otherwise), `@sanity/preview-url-secret` 4.0.8 to 4.1.5 (5.7.3 and 6.9.1 both want ^4.1.2, and 4.0.8 would nest a second copy). Stops at 6.9.1 deliberately: 6.9.2 is a PATCH release that crosses to `@sanity/ui` 4, which is a real migration. `@sanity/icons` stays on 3.x hoisted and the `sanity-plugin-utils` 2.0.6 override stays pinned. The same set is already human-verified in a signed-in Studio on presacademy, reid-design-site and mas-monograms. Verified here: exactly one `@sanity/ui` and one `styled-components` on disk and in the lockfile, one `errors.md#` bundle, typegen byte-stable, parity 10/10 after re-capture (the Studio's vendor CSS chunks moved; no page content did).

**B — The family test standard** (new PORTS card 35). The repo had `ci.yml`, `deploy-staging.yml` and `publish-due.yml`, no Playwright, no Lighthouse, and a CI job that ran typegen, build and the unit tests only. It now runs the family's whole gate: `astro check`, eslint, `prettier --check`, unit tests, `check:links`, the four Playwright suites on chromium and a WebKit iPhone profile, and a separate `lighthouse.yml` with an explicit url list and accessibility as a hard gate at 1.0.

Turning gates on for the first time is where the value was. `astro check` reported **222 errors**, and 163 of them were one bug: `sanityFetch(query, {}, null)` let TypeScript infer `T` from the empty fallback, so every page helper resolved to `Promise<null>` and every property read downstream was "does not exist on type 'never'". Two overloads on `sanityFetch` name what an untyped GROQ projection actually returns. The rest: `modules/` was being type checked in place when it is staged by design; nine components each redeclared a narrower image type than the projection returns (one shared `SanityImageObject` now); four hand-authored "U7" projected block types had drifted from the generated ones, which was a TODO the type check closed; a patch-builder interface that made `.setIfMissing(...).commit()` uncompilable; a spacer-divider branch testing for a variant the schema has never offered.

`check:links` found **135 broken internal links across ten pages**, all one cause: the nine opt-in module routes were treated as visible-unless-switched-off, like core sections, so a fresh clone rendered a footer and a nav full of links to routes it never builds. `getSectionVisibility` now has two rules, one per kind of route.

The Playwright suites found three real bugs on their first run: two region landmarks with the same accessible name on `/privacy`; `text-foreground/60` under 4.5:1 in two places; and every `<select>` on `/contact` with no focus indicator at all on Safari and iOS, because a Tailwind `focus:ring` is a box-shadow and WebKit drops box-shadow on native form controls. Chromium showed nothing wrong for that last one, which is the argument for running the sweep on both engines.

The format pass was verified with `npm run parity`, not by eye. A prettier pass can silently eat a meaningful space in an Astro template, and the one apparent text difference turned out to be React's `<!-- -->` separator moving where the parity normalizer collapses whitespace; the real `dist/client` HTML still reads "How did you hear about us? (optional)".

**C — Harvested from `ncs-church-starter`** before it is retired as a second library of record: `sanity-backup.yml` and `uptime.yml`, in the church starter's template stance (gated, schedule commented out, project id and origin read from repo variables) with the fixes the client repos had already earned folded in, encrypt-before-upload and the `--project-id` flag. The church-specific schema types were deliberately not taken; that is a separate decision.

_2026-08-28 — The Squarespace-grade editor: Astro 7, Sanity 6.4, embedded single-package Studio, live preview, in-canvas section controls._

The template takes the whole modern stack its descendant presacademy pioneered, so every future site is born with it. Four phases, each gated before the next.

**A — Framework upgrade.** Astro 6.3 to 7.2, `@astrojs/cloudflare` 13.5.5 to **14.2.4 exact** (the last release whose wrangler peer range fits the pin below), `@astrojs/react` 6, `@astrojs/mdx` 7, `wrangler` pinned `~4.110.0` (PORTS card 14), react/react-dom/react-is pinned **exact** 19.2.7 (card 13), and the `overrides: { vite: "^7" }` pin removed (it broke Astro 7's prerender step). `scripts/with-workerd.mjs` is now wired into `npm run build` (card 1), so the Windows prerender crash is handled rather than merely documented. Plus `session: false` in `astro.config.mjs`, `nodejs_compat` in `wrangler.jsonc`, `assets.not_found_handling` removed, and deploy switched to `wrangler deploy -c dist/server/wrangler.json`. Adapter 14 splits the output: `dist/client` is the static site, `dist/server` the SSR bundle.

Parity baselines were re-captured. Every diff across all nine routes was categorized first, and all of them fell into four framework-caused classes with nothing structural left over: the `<meta name="generator">` version string; `<astro-island uid="...">` (a generated identity, same family as the `prefix` the harness already normalizes); inline `<script>` and `<style>` bodies (esbuild and lightningcss changed their output); and whitespace inside text nodes (the Astro 7 compiler trims it). No class, id, aria, href, JSON-LD or text changed anywhere.

**B — Sanity 6.4 pin set and the studio fold.** The nested `studio/` package is **gone**. Schemas, structure and components moved to `src/sanity/`, the configs to the repo root (`sanity.config.ts`, `sanity.cli.ts`): one `package.json`, one `node_modules`. That is the real fix for the dual-module-tree crash that took presacademy's production Studio down on 2026-08-26 (card 10); `resolve.dedupe` is kept anyway as cheap insurance against a fork reintroducing a second resolution root. The Studio is now **embedded at `/studio`** through `@sanity/astro` and rebuilds with every deploy, so there is no hosted Studio to drift and no `studio:deploy` step; `sanity.cli.ts` deliberately omits `studioHost`/`deployment` so a stray `sanity deploy` cannot recreate the split. `buildLegacyTheme` (light-only, which left the Studio's dark mode all-white) gave way to `@sanity/ui`'s `buildTheme`; `apply-brand` now rewrites the Studio's two font stacks instead of a dozen legacy colour variables, and `brand.config.json`'s `studio.themeProps` became `studio.fonts`. `sanity-plugin-iframe-pane` retired in favour of the Presentation tool. CI lost its studio-prefix steps. Verified: exactly one `@sanity/ui` on disk, exactly one `errors.md#` chunk in the build, typegen byte-stable, standalone `npx sanity build .studio-dist` green, and the embedded Studio mounting in a real browser.

One markup change arrived with the refreshed lockfile and is unrelated to the fold: a newer react-aria inside `sonner` adds `data-react-aria-top-layer="true"` to the toaster region. After masking the framework-caused classes above, that attribute was the **only** residual difference on any page, which is what proved the fold itself render-neutral. Baselines re-captured a second time to absorb it.

**C — The preview stack** (cards 10 and 11). `src/lib/cms-preview.ts` (a second, runtime, draft-and-stega Sanity client, with this template's own enum fields seeded into `NON_STEGA_FIELDS`), `src/lib/preview-auth.ts` (a token fingerprint in the preview cookie, not the package's forgeable `'true'`), `/api/draft-mode/enable` and `/disable`, `/preview/live` (an SSE proxy over Sanity's listen API, never a poll), `/preview/[...slug]`, `PreviewLayout.astro` (chrome-less, forced motion end-states, the embedded-frame exit-button fix, and the click interceptor carrying this template's route map), `VisualEditingOverlay.tsx`, plus `src/sanity/resolve.ts` and a `PreviewNavigator` page list wired into `presentationTool`.

Because this template is page-builder-first, the four builder pages and every custom `page` doc preview in **full fidelity** through the same `SectionRenderer` the live page uses. The five bespoke pages (faq, contact, journal, privacy, 404) preview as their editable surface with a note saying so. No page-builder conversion was attempted: that is card 12 and a separate job.

Everything **fails closed** without `SANITY_TOKEN`, and legibly. The preview entry points answer 503 naming the missing pieces rather than throwing a Sanity client error, because a fresh clone hitting `/preview` should read as "not set up yet", not as a bug in the template.

**D — In-canvas section controls** (card 17). `src/lib/preview-edit-attr.ts` plus a preview-only wrapper in `SectionRenderer`: with `editDoc` absent the wrapper is a `<Fragment>` and renders nothing at all, which is why the static build stayed byte-identical and `npm run parity compare` passes 10/10 with the feature installed. The `pageBuilder` arrays gained a shared grouped, searchable insert menu (`SECTION_INSERT_MENU` in `sections.ts`), which is the menu that opens **in the canvas** when an editor inserts a section. The seeded in-Studio guide gained a Preview map row, two how-tos and a tip covering all of it.

_2026-05-30 — Forked from the Reid Design build; genericized to the ncs-astro-sanity-starter (core foundation + opt-in module library + bootstrap docs). Future projects start their own history from this entry._

---

_2026-06-12 — Audit-driven hardening + UI component stack + CI (U1-U10)._

- **Structured data genericization.** Replaced client-specific nouns in JSON-LD, OG, and page copy with generic tokens. `businessType` field on `siteSettings` drives the schema.org `@type` value.
- **Robots + RSS endpoints.** `src/pages/robots.txt.ts` generates allow-all + correct sitemap reference at build time; `src/pages/journal/rss.xml.ts` wires `@astrojs/rss` for the journal feed.
- **Accessibility fixes.** Skip-link, aria labels, color contrast, heading hierarchy, and keyboard-nav passes across all section components.
- **Module query fixes.** Co-located query files for all 13 modules audited and corrected; module routes verified against `siteSettings.sectionVisibility` toggles.
- **apply-brand hardening.** `--check` flag (dry-run diff mode), `brand.config.schema.json` validation, `--radius` knob for border-radius token, `workerName`/`domain` field coverage, print footer rewrite. `docs/brand/` is current.
- **CI + lint + 79 tests.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` mirrors the local gate (`npm run check`): typegen, site build, Studio build, all tests. `npm run check` is the canonical one-command pre-commit gate. New scripts: `lint`, `lint:fix`, `format`. Test suite expanded to 79 tests across 6 files in `src/lib/` (adds `scriptAccent`, `slugify`, `sectionVisibility`, `utils`).
- **UI component stack.** `src/components/starwind/` (Astro-native accordion, dialog, dropdown, tabs primitives). `src/components/primereact/` (PrimeReact escape hatch with `PrimeIsland.tsx` wrapper). Magic UI token audit applied. `docs/agent/component-sources.md` added (shadcn, Radix, Vega, Starwind, Magic UI, PrimeReact sourcing guide + token-remap cheat sheet).
- **Four new page-builder blocks.** `faqSection` (inline FAQ accordion, SELF_CONTAINED, references `faqItem` docs), `logoStripSection` (client/partner logo row or grid, SELF_CONTAINED), `embedSection` (sandboxed iframe/URL embed for Calendly/Tally/etc., SELF_CONTAINED), `teamSection` (inline team member grid, SELF_CONTAINED). Block library grows from 17 to 21 total (11 general + 10 rich).
- **Schema flexibility.** `businessInfo` gains `businessModel` (`'in-person'`/`'remote'`) and `additionalLocations`. `siteSettings` gains `socialLinks` structured array (supersedes legacy flat social fields). `faqCategory` document type added; `faqItem` gains `categoryRef` reference field.
- **Three new modules + virtual-services rename.** `events`, `donations`, `team` modules added (routes: `/events`, `/donate`, `/team`). `e-design` module renamed to `virtual-services` (route: `/virtual-services`). Total modules: 13.

_2026-06-12 — Page-builder-first upgrade (A through D)._

**A -- Page-builder core.** `studio/schemaTypes/sections.ts` defines 9 general block types (heroSection, richTextSection, imageTextSection, gallerySection, quoteSection, statSection, ctaBandSection, videoSection, spacerSection), a `SECTION_TYPES` constant as the single source of truth, and `additionalSectionsField` as an append zone any page can import. `src/components/SectionRenderer.astro` maps each block `_type` to a component and owns the alternating-surface cadence (logic extracted to `src/lib/sectionCadence.ts`, unit-tested; blocks carry no color field). A custom `page` document type gives editors free-form pages served by `src/pages/[slug].astro`. Reserved-slug guard lives inside `getStaticPaths` (Astro isolated-scope requirement); shared list at `src/lib/reservedSlugs.ts`, unit-tested. `businessInfo` singleton split out of `siteSettings` (service areas, travel, availability, geo); `getSiteSettings()` merges them back under flat names. GROQ `sectionsProjection()`, `getPage`, `getAllPageSlugs`, and `getNavPages` added to `src/lib/queries.ts`.

**B -- Section-driven core pages.** `studio/schemaTypes/richSections.ts` defines 8 rich section types (founderSection, servicesGridSection, testimonialsSection, storySection, valuesSection, processSection, serviceAreaSection, guaranteeSection) and per-page curated lists. The home, about, services, and process pages now hold a `pageBuilder` array (their old structured fields are hidden + readOnly for rollback); all four routes render via `<SectionRenderer>`. `src/data/defaultSections.ts` holds code-defined default section arrays so a fresh clone with no Sanity project still renders non-blank. The process page graduated from a module into core. `scripts/seed-core.mjs` seeds the `pageBuilder` arrays.

**C -- Modules (lean).** The 9 feature modules (portfolio, shop, e-design, gift-certificates, press, resources, lead-magnets, style-quiz, budget-calculator) ship built and OFF under `modules/`. Enabling is now copy-a-folder: each module's query functions live at `modules/<name>/src/lib/<name>Queries.ts`, so there is no hand-pasting into core `queries.ts`. `siteSettings.sectionVisibility` toggles each. Offering pages (e-design, gift, press, resources) stay fixed-order by choice.

**D -- Brand reskin system.** `brand/brand.config.json` is the single source of truth (identity + palette + fonts + logo paths). `npm run apply-brand` (`scripts/apply-brand.mjs`) deterministically and idempotently rewrites `globals.css` tokens, `src/data/site.ts`, `studio/sanity.config.ts`, OG inputs, and font imports, then regenerates the OG image. The `/reskin` Claude skill (`.claude/skills/reskin/SKILL.md`) orchestrates the full rebrand: interview, font package install, apply-brand, WCAG AA contrast check, visual check via defaultSections, copy retone, and human checklist.

**Verification baseline after this upgrade:** `npm run build`, `npm run typegen`, `npm test` (22 node --test unit tests for sectionCadence + reservedSlugs), `npm --prefix studio run build`. Live Playwright screenshots and actual seed runs require a connected Sanity project.*

_2026-08-27: This starter becomes the library of record for the site family._

Six canonical files were installed at their natural paths, each carrying a first-line
`PORTABLE:` marker naming this repo as the library of record: `scripts/with-workerd.mjs`
(Windows workerd wrapper, a no-op until the Astro 7 / adapter 14 upgrade),
`scripts/free-dist.mjs` (releases a stale dev server's handle on `dist/`, genericized so
a copy needs no edit in any repo), `scripts/page-parity.mjs` (rendered-HTML parity
harness, parameterized to auto-detect `dist/client` versus `dist` and to auto-discover
its routes), `scripts/lib/sanity-lib.mjs` (seed/patch plumbing: dry-run-by-default apply
gate, Portable Text builders, idempotent asset uploader, reconciled onto the existing
`scripts/lib/loadEnv.mjs` rather than carrying a second env parser), `src/lib/contrast.ts`
(WCAG contrast math), and the new `scripts/sync-check.mjs` (the drift check itself).

`src/lib/theme-tokens.test.ts` applies contrast.ts to this repo's own `@theme` palette,
so a reskin that pushes body text under 4.5:1 fails `npm test` instead of shipping.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` gained the stale-types guard: CI regenerates the Sanity types
and fails if the committed `src/lib/sanity.types.ts` differs. New npm scripts: `parity`,
`sync-check`, `free-dist`. Parity baselines for the nine built routes are committed in
`scripts/.parity/`, proven by a build, capture, rebuild, compare cycle at 9/9 PASS.

`PORTS.md` was created with fifteen port cards and the applied-to matrix. See the
[Library of record](../../CLAUDE.md) section of CLAUDE.md for the working rules, above
all the docs-in-sync clause: an improvement that generalizes gets a card in the same
commit that generalizes it.
