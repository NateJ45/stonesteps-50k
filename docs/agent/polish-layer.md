# Polish layer

> Custom CSS utilities and JS behaviors layered on Tailwind: brand stripe, card-lift, surface-warm, reading-progress, sticky-header, nav-underline, paper-grain, and print stylesheet.

Animation behaviors (Lenis, scroll reveals, stagger grid, hero entry, view transitions, Ken Burns slideshow, script accent opt-in) are documented separately in `animation.md`.

## Polish layer

Custom CSS utilities and JS behaviors layered on top of Tailwind + shadcn. All declared in `src/styles/globals.css` and (where JS is needed) initialized in `BaseLayout.astro` with re-init on `astro:page-load` so they survive View Transitions.

### Brand-stripe rhythm (THE primary visual signature)

A 2px brand-color line -- `<div class="h-0.5 bg-primary" aria-hidden="true"></div>` -- is the starter's repeating visual signature. It appears at the top of:

- The site header (above the eyebrow strip)
- The mobile menu drawer (`border-t-4 border-t-primary` on SheetContent)
- The footer (above the brand block)
- Every marketing card (ServiceCard, JournalCard, TestimonialCard)
- The FinalCta dark panel

If you add a new card-like component or section that should feel part of the brand, include this stripe at the top edge. The repetition is what makes the site read as one designed object.

### Card resting + hover shadow

All marketing cards share a soft resting shadow that deepens on hover via `.card-lift`:

```html
<article class="card-lift shadow-[0_4px_18px_-14px_rgba(42,45,49,0.18)] ..."></article>
```

The `card-lift` utility class lives in `globals.css`. Defines `:hover { translateY(-2px); box-shadow: 0 16px 34px -18px ... }`. Always-on-card components opt in via the class.

### Tactile button press

`.press-tactile` adds a 1px depress on `:active` so CTAs feel physical:

```html
<a class="press-tactile bg-primary text-primary-foreground ...">Book a consultation</a>
```

Applied to CtaLink, header consultation pill, contact form submit, sticky CTA chip, filter chips. Honors reduced-motion via the global transition kill.

### Animated nav underline (`.nav-underline`)

Brand-primary underline that slides in from the center on hover and locks full-width on `[aria-current="page"]`. Applied to every link in the primary nav. Defined in `globals.css`.

### Sticky header behavior (`.site-header`)

The header has `position: sticky; top: 0`. A scroll listener in BaseLayout sets `data-state="hidden"` on it when the user scrolls down past 120px, which CSS translates to `translateY(-100%)`. Scroll up = the header reveals. Pinned permanently under reduced-motion.

### Reading progress (`.reading-progress`)

3px brand-color track at the top of journal posts. Inner div `scaleX`'s from 0 to 1 as the reader scrolls through `<article>`. GPU-only animation (transform), throttled via requestAnimationFrame. Reduced-motion users get a static full bar so the affordance remains.

Lives in `ReadingProgress.astro` (rendered inside `BaseLayout`'s slot on journal post pages).

### Surface-warm (`.surface-warm`)

A tinted radial gradient overlay for sections that want dimensional warmth. Uses `rgba(var(--tint-rgb), 0.07)` in light, `rgba(var(--tint-rgb), 0.10)` in dark. Apply alongside `bg-muted` or `bg-background`:

```html
<section class="surface-warm bg-muted">...</section>
```

Pairs with the global `body::before` paper-grain. Update `--tint-rgb` in `globals.css` when re-skinning the project so this overlay picks up the new hue automatically.

### Paper grain (`body::before`)

A faint SVG noise tile at 4% opacity sits behind everything via `body::before`. Adds tactile warmth across all surfaces. Multiply blend in light, screen blend in dark. Pointer-events none, z-index 0.

### Image zoom + tint on hover (`.img-zoom` / `.img-tint` / `.img-tint-light`)

Card hero images scale to 1.06 and gain a faint brand-color wash on hover. Add `.img-zoom` to the `overflow-hidden` image wrapper and drop an `.img-tint` (heavier, ~0.15 opacity) or `.img-tint.img-tint-light` (lighter, ~0.08 opacity) div inside it. The tint color is `rgba(var(--tint-rgb), <opacity>)` so it inherits the project palette. Transitions are gated behind `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`.

### Process connector lines (`.step-connector`)

A 2px thread draws downward from each step number badge toward the next step. `ProcessStep.astro` renders `<div class="step-connector">` in its left flex column when `!isLast`; the article grid is `items-stretch` so the connector's `flex: 1` fills the step height. The track rests at a muted color and a `::after` fill animates to the brand primary color (`scaleY` 0 to 1) when the BaseLayout observer adds `.is-visible`. Pass `isLast` on the final step in any sequence. Reduced-motion users get the filled track instantly, no draw.

### Editorial typography -- drop cap + blockquote (`.prose-drop-cap` / `.prose-blockquote`)

Journal posts open with a floated display-font drop cap on the first paragraph and render blockquotes with a 3px brand-primary left border in italic. `JournalPortableText.tsx` adds `.prose-drop-cap` to the first `normal` block only (a `firstNormalRendered` flag in the `makeComponents()` closure, rebuilt per render) and sets `className="prose-blockquote"` on blockquotes. The drop cap is pure CSS (`::first-letter`) -- nothing to gate for reduced motion. Don't apply `.prose-drop-cap` to short paragraphs; the floated cap needs a substantial opening paragraph to wrap against.

### Section dividers (when to use)

`SectionDivider.astro` renders a brand ornament for the specific case where two adjacent sections share a background color and need a visual break. **Don't sprinkle between every section** -- the alternating `bg-background` / `bg-muted` cadence already does that work. Reserve dividers for the edge case where two same-background sections would blur together.

### Print stylesheet

A `@media print` block in `globals.css` suppresses nav, footer, CTAs, and decorative elements, and sets `color: black; background: white` on the body so journal post content prints cleanly. This is intentionally minimal -- the goal is a legible print, not a designed one.

### View Transitions discipline

Astro View Transitions are wired via `<ClientRouter />` in BaseLayout. Any client-side script that needs to re-run on every navigation must listen to `astro:page-load`:

```js
function initThing() {
  /* ... */
}
initThing();
document.addEventListener('astro:page-load', initThing);
```

Pattern used by: scroll-reveal observer, sticky-header listener, reading-progress, sticky CTA chip. See `animation.md` for details on the Lenis + view-transitions interaction, which is a special case.

Cross-reference: `animation.md` covers Lenis smooth scroll, scroll reveals, stagger reveals, hero entry stagger, Ken Burns slideshow, view-transition cross-fade, and the opt-in script accent.
