# New Project Setup Runbook

Read `CLAUDE.md` first, then follow this guide in order. Each step lists the
exact commands and files to touch. Complete all steps before launch.

This runbook is the single entry point for adapting the starter to a new client
site. The Foundation-vs-Safe-to-edit taxonomy in `CLAUDE.md` tells you which
files are safe to change freely and which require a planned session. Read that
section before touching anything in the "Foundation" list.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Node 22.12+** (`node --version`). The starter requires Node 22.12 or later.
- **A GitHub repository** for the new project. Create it at github.com before cloning.
- **A Cloudflare account** at [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com). The Workers free tier is enough for most projects.
- **A unique Worker name** in mind. The `name` field in `wrangler.jsonc` must be globally unique across all Cloudflare accounts. Choose a name you control before starting -- it becomes your `<name>.<account>.workers.dev` subdomain.

---

## Step 1 -- Clone the template and install dependencies

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ncs-astro-sanity-starter my-new-site
cd my-new-site
npm install
```

One package, one `node_modules`. The Sanity Studio lives in this repo (its old
nested `studio/` package was folded in on 2026-08-28) and is served at `/studio`
by the site itself.

The build works with no Sanity project configured. `sanityFetch` returns empty
fallbacks and every page renders its empty-state content. You can run
`npm run build` immediately after install to confirm the baseline compiles.

---

## Step 2 -- Point Sanity

**a) Create or choose a Sanity project**

Go to [sanity.io/manage](https://sanity.io/manage) and create a new project
(or choose an existing one). Copy the project ID.

**b) Set the env vars**

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in:

```
PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN=<Viewer token from manage.sanity.io -> API -> Tokens>
SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN=<Editor token -- only needed for seed scripts>
SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET=production
SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_URL=https://your-worker-name.your-account.workers.dev
```

`PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` defaults to `production`; leave it unless you have a
reason to use a different dataset.

**c) Allow your origins in Sanity CORS**

The Studio is EMBEDDED at `/studio` on your own site, so it talks to the Sanity
API from your origin. That origin has to be on the project's allow list, or the
Studio loads and then fails to sign in.

```powershell
npx sanity cors add http://localhost:4321 --credentials
npx sanity cors add https://your-worker-name.your-account.workers.dev --credentials
```

Add the real domain too, once DNS is pointed. You will be prompted to log in to
Sanity on first run.

**d) Set the preview secret**

The live draft preview (`/preview/**`) reads drafts through a Worker runtime
secret, which is separate from the build-time variables in `.env`.

```powershell
Copy-Item .dev.vars.example .dev.vars   # then paste a Viewer token into it
npx wrangler secret put SANITY_TOKEN    # the same token, for production
```

Without it the public site is unaffected and the preview simply reports that it
is not configured yet. See `.dev.vars.example`.

**e) Invite the editor**

Invite them at [manage.sanity.io](https://manage.sanity.io) under the project ->
Members tab, and send them `https://<your-site>/studio`. They do NOT need a
development environment.

**There is NO separate Studio deploy.** The Studio is built by `astro build` and
published with the site, so a schema change reaches editors on your next deploy.
Do not run `npx sanity deploy`: it would publish a standalone Studio that
silently falls behind this one. Never click "Remove field" in Studio -- it
deletes document data permanently.

---

## Step 3 -- Set identity and domain

**a) Fill `src/data/site.ts`**

Replace every placeholder value: `name`, `studio`, `domain`, `url`,
`storageKeyPrefix`, `themeStorageKey`, and the `brandColors` mirrors (keep
these in sync with the palette tokens you set in Step 4).

**b) Set `astro.config.mjs` `site`**

Locate the `site:` key in `astro.config.mjs` and set it to the production URL
(e.g. `https://example.com`). This drives the sitemap and canonical tags.

**c) Set `wrangler.jsonc` `name`**

Locate the `"name"` field at the top of `wrangler.jsonc` and set it to the
Worker name (e.g. `my-new-site`). This is the subdomain under
`your-account.workers.dev` and becomes your custom domain route if you add one
in the Cloudflare dashboard.

---

## Step 4 -- Apply the brand identity

The fastest path is the `/reskin` skill (if you are working inside Claude Code):

```
/reskin
```

The skill interviews you for brand inputs, writes `brand/brand.config.json`,
runs `npm run apply-brand`, checks WCAG AA contrast, and reports what still
needs a human (logos, photography, voice review).

### Manual path (if not using Claude Code)

Fill in `brand/brand.config.json` at the repo root. The file ships pre-filled
with the neutral Slate/Ink/Paper defaults. Change only what differs from the
defaults. Then run:

```powershell
npm run apply-brand
```

This rewrites `src/styles/globals.css` (`@theme` tokens, `:root`, `.dark`, font
imports), `src/data/site.ts` (`name`, `domain`, `brandColors`),
`sanity.config.ts` (`studioThemeProps`), and the OG generator inputs,
then regenerates `public/og-default.png`.

After `apply-brand`, verify with:

```powershell
git diff
npm run build
```

**Font packages:** If you change `fonts.display` or `fonts.body` to a new family,
install the matching `@fontsource` package BEFORE running `apply-brand`:

```powershell
npm install @fontsource/<family>
```

Then set `fonts.display.imports` (or `fonts.body.imports`) in
`brand/brand.config.json` to the installed CSS import paths.

**Logo files:** Drop `logo-light.*` and `logo-dark.*` into `src/assets/`. The
Header and Footer import them via Astro's `Image` component.

**Favicon:** Replace `public/favicon.svg`.

**Per-page OG images:** Once Sanity is configured and `.env` is set, run:

```powershell
npm run og:pages
```

See `docs/agent/theme-and-color.md` for the full token map if you need to make
manual token adjustments beyond what `apply-brand` covers.

---

## Step 5 -- Voice

Fill in `docs/brand/voice.md` with the client's specific tone, vocabulary
rules, and banned words. This file is what an AI agent reads when writing or
editing site copy for this project. The `CLAUDE.md` Communication style section
is the always-on baseline; `voice.md` layers the client's specifics on top.

---

## Step 6 -- Replace placeholder copy

Walk the core pages and swap all "Studio Starter" placeholder text for real
copy. Files to review:

- `src/pages/index.astro` -- hero headline, tagline, section subheads
- `src/pages/about.astro` -- bio, story copy
- `src/pages/services.astro` -- service names and descriptions (will also come
  from Sanity once content is seeded, but static fallbacks still need to read
  correctly)
- `src/pages/faq.astro` -- any hardcoded FAQ fallbacks
- `src/pages/contact.astro` -- contact section copy
- `src/pages/privacy.astro` -- legal copy if using the static fallback

No em-dashes in site copy. Use commas, colons, or restructure the sentence.

---

## Step 7 -- Enable modules

Review `docs/modules/README.md` for the full module index and presets. Enable
only what this client needs.

For each module you want to activate:

1. Open its enable doc (`docs/modules/<name>.md`).
2. Follow all numbered steps in order:
   - Step 1: copy schemas into `src/sanity/schemaTypes/`.
   - Step 2: register schemas in `src/sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts`.
   - Step 3: register in `src/sanity/structure.ts`.
   - Step 3b: if a new section type carries a dropdown whose exact value drives
     rendering, add that field name to `NON_STEGA_FIELDS` in `src/lib/cms-preview.ts`.
   - Step 4: copy app files with `Copy-Item`.
   - **Step 4b: add the module's query functions to `src/lib/queries.ts`.**
     This step is easy to miss -- the core starter does not include module
     queries, so they must be added manually from the module's enable doc.
   - Step 5+: add nav entries, sectionVisibility flags, and any module-specific
     config.
3. Run `npm run typegen` after adding schemas and commit the regenerated types. The embedded Studio picks them up on the next build.

---

## Step 8 -- Seed content

**Core pages:**

Once `PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN` are set in `.env`,
run the core seed script to populate the core Sanity pages with neutral
placeholder content:

```powershell
node scripts/seed-core.mjs
```

This creates the `siteSettings`, `homePage`, `aboutPage`, `servicesPage`,
`faqPage`, `contactPage`, and `privacyPage` singletons in your Sanity dataset
so the Studio has documents to edit immediately. Replace the placeholder text
with real copy in Studio or directly in the page files.

**Module seeds:**

Each enabled module that ships a `seed.mjs` has its seeding instructions in its
enable doc. Run any module seeds after running `seed-core.mjs`.

---

## Step 9 -- Verify

```powershell
npm run build
```

Then run the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Check every core page in both light and dark mode at both mobile (~375px) and
desktop (~1280px):

- Home, About, Services, FAQ, Contact, Journal index, Journal post, Privacy, 404
- Every enabled module's routes

Run Lighthouse on the key pages (Home, Services, Contact). Targets:
100/100/100/100 on desktop. If a score drops, find the cause before launch.

See `CLAUDE.md` Visual verification workflow for the full checklist.

---

## Step 10 -- Deploy

**a) Build and deploy**

```powershell
npm run deploy
```

`npm run deploy` runs `npm run build` (`astro build` only) followed by
`wrangler deploy`. It does NOT run typegen. If you changed any schemas since
the last typegen run, run `npm run typegen` first. On first deploy you may be
prompted to log in to Cloudflare.

**b) Wire environment variables in Cloudflare**

Go to Workers & Pages -> your Worker -> Settings -> Variables. Add the same
env vars from `.env` as Secret bindings (especially `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN`;
the `PUBLIC_*` vars can be plain).

**c) Wire the Sanity -> Cloudflare publish webhook**

The site is fully prerendered, so a Sanity content edit only goes live after a
rebuild. Wire a deploy hook so editors don't need a developer for every content
change. Full authoritative steps are in `docs/agent/deployment.md`; summary:

1. **Create the Cloudflare deploy hook** at Cloudflare dashboard -> Workers &
   Pages -> your Worker -> Settings -> Build hooks (or Triggers -> Deploy hooks,
   depending on the UI version). Name it `Sanity content publish`, branch
   `main`. Copy the generated URL.

2. **Create the Sanity webhook** at manage.sanity.io -> your project -> API ->
   GROQ-powered Webhooks. Name it `Rebuild live site`, dataset `production`,
   trigger on Create + Update + Delete, HTTP method POST, paste the Cloudflare
   deploy hook URL. Apply the deny-list GROQ filter (see `docs/agent/deployment.md`
   for the exact filter string).

3. **Test:** publish a field change in Sanity Studio and watch the Cloudflare
   Deployments tab. A new build should kick off within about 10 seconds.

**d) Pre-launch checklist**

Run through `docs/bootstrap/setup-checklist.md` before DNS cutover.

## What NOT to casually edit

Before making changes to any "Foundation" file, read the Foundation-vs-Safe-to-edit
taxonomy in `CLAUDE.md`. Key files to route through a planned session:

- `src/styles/globals.css` beyond the design-seam tokens (polish-layer utilities,
  shadcn overrides, base resets)
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` (anti-FOUC script, scroll wiring, Lenis init)
- `src/lib/sanity.ts` (the `isSanityUnconfigured` guard is load-bearing)
- `src/sanity/schemaTypes/*.ts` (field changes can break existing Sanity content)
- `src/lib/queries.ts` and `src/lib/sanity.types.ts`
- `astro.config.mjs`, `wrangler.jsonc`, `package.json`
- `public/_headers` (security headers)

The `src/components/ui/` shadcn primitives are also Foundation: if you
reinstall via `npx shadcn add`, reapply the customizations documented in
`CLAUDE.md` (notably the `accordion.tsx` changes).
