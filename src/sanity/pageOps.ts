// PORTABLE: canonical copy - ncs-astro-sanity-starter is the library of record for this file
// =============================================================================
// pageOps - duplicate, archive, and add a saved section, as plain functions
// =============================================================================
// "Pages as first-class objects" gives an editor verbs the Studio does not
// ship: copy this page, put it away, bring it back, drop a saved section onto
// it. The verbs are the same wherever they are offered, so the LOGIC lives here
// and the surfaces stay thin:
//
//   - src/sanity/components/pageActions.tsx  (the publish-menu actions, in every
//     repo in this family)
//   - src/sanity/components/PreviewNavigator.tsx (per-row buttons, in the repos
//     that ship the Presentation page list)
//   - src/sanity/actions/addPresetToPage.tsx (a "put this on a page" dialog, in
//     the repos that have no navigator to offer it from)
//
// DUPLICATE makes a DRAFT. A copy that published itself would be a second live
// page at a made-up address, so the copy starts as a draft the editor finishes
// and publishes deliberately. It starts from the draft twin when there is one,
// because that is the newest wording. Every nested `_key` is regenerated: two
// array members sharing a key inside one document is a real corruption, and
// Sanity's own conflict resolution behaves unpredictably when it happens.
//
// ARCHIVE is a patch, not a delete. `archived: true` is set on BOTH twins (the
// draft and the published document) so the page drops off the live site at the
// next build whether or not it had unpublished edits. Nothing is thrown away and
// nothing is reference-blocked, so Restore is complete: it unsets the same field
// on both twins and the page comes back exactly as it was.
//
// ADD A SAVED SECTION writes to the DRAFT, always. A saved section that
// appeared on the live page the moment it was clicked would be a publish nobody
// asked for, so the section is appended to the draft twin (made from the
// published document first when there is not one yet, which is exactly what
// typing in the form would have done) and the editor still presses Publish.
//
// The queries the live site runs test `archived != true`, never `archived ==
// false`, so a page made before this field existed stays visible.
// =============================================================================
