// Foundation, edit with care
// Sanity client + image URL builder. Reads project ID / dataset / API version
// from env at build time. The site is fully prerendered (output: 'static'),
// so all Sanity reads happen at build time in Node, not in the Cloudflare runtime.
//
// Token-based reads (current default):
//   This project's dataset is configured such that anonymous queries are filtered
//   down to a subset of document types (a Sanity-side restriction we couldn't
//   surface in Manage UI — only the page singletons came through anon, every
//   collection returned empty). Passing SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN bypasses the
//   filter and reads the full dataset.
//
//   When a token is set, Sanity disables CDN caching for the request (auth
//   responses can vary by user, so CDN can't safely cache). Build-time only,
//   not a runtime hot path, so the latency is harmless.
//
// Anon fallback:
//   If SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN is missing, the client still constructs and queries
//   work for whatever the API surfaces anonymously. Useful for local-dev sanity
//   checks before the token's been wired into Cloudflare's env vars.
//
// Graceful empty-state:
//   When PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID is absent or set to the placeholder string
//   "your-project-id", sanityFetch() short-circuits and returns the provided
//   fallback without making any network call. This lets `npm run build` succeed
//   on a fresh clone with no Sanity project configured — pages render their
//   existing empty-state fallbacks. The populated case (real project ID set)
//   works exactly as before.

/**
 * Guarded fetch wrapper — the single chokepoint for all Sanity data queries.
 *
 * When Sanity is unconfigured (PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID absent or placeholder),
 * returns `fallback` immediately without any network call so the build succeeds
 * with empty-state content. When configured, forwards to `client.fetch` and
 * catches any network error, logging a warning and returning `fallback` rather
 * than crashing the build.
 *
 * All query helpers in queries.ts route through this function.
 *
 * ── WHY THE TWO EMPTY-SHAPE OVERLOADS ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Nearly every helper in queries.ts passes an EMPTY fallback: `null` for a
 * singleton that may not exist yet, `[]` for a collection that may be empty.
 * With a single signature TypeScript infers T from that argument, so those
 * calls resolve to `Promise<null>` and `Promise<never[]>`, and then every
 * property read downstream reports "does not exist on type 'never'". That is
 * not type safety, it is the type system having been handed no information:
 * `astro check` produced 163 of those errors on this repo the first time it
 * ran (2026-09-06). The GROQ shapes are not generated (typegen emits schema
 * types, and these queries are plain template literals rather than
 * `defineQuery` calls), so the honest description of what comes back is
 * "a Sanity result object", not `never`.
 *
 * The overloads say exactly that, and they leave the explicit-generic path
 * intact: `sanityFetch<MyType>(query, {}, null)` still returns `MyType | null`.
 * Making these queries genuinely typed means moving them to `defineQuery` so
 * typegen can read them, which is its own job.
