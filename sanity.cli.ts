// There is ONE canonical Studio: the one embedded at /studio on the built site.
// It rebuilds on every deploy, so its schema is always current and cannot drift.
//
// DO NOT run `npx sanity deploy`. That publishes a SEPARATE standalone Studio
// to <studioHost>.sanity.studio, which only updates when someone re-runs the
// deploy by hand: it silently falls behind the embedded Studio while pointing
// at the same production data. There is deliberately no studioHost/deployment
// block here so a stray `sanity deploy` cannot recreate the split. (Anti-drift
// pattern taken from presacademy, which learned it the hard way.)
//
// Also note `sanity build` writes to ./dist by default, which would clobber the
// Astro build output. There is no `studio:build` script for that reason: the
// Studio is built by `astro build` as part of the site. If you ever need a
// standalone Studio bundle, pass an explicit output dir:
//   npx sanity build .studio-dist
