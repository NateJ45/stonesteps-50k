# NCS Astro + Sanity Starter — Operations Playbook

Tactical reference for common tasks. `CLAUDE.md` is the architecture and design reference; this file is the "how do I actually do X" guide.

If you are a future Claude session and you can only read one doc, read `CLAUDE.md`. This file is the second one to open when you need to do something specific (deploy, patch, audit, regenerate).

---

## Reskin (apply a new brand identity)

The primary path for adapting this starter to a new client is the `/reskin` skill. It interviews you for brand inputs, writes `brand/brand.config.json`, runs `npm run apply-brand`, checks contrast, and screenshots the result.

**Quick start with the skill:**

1. Open a Claude session in this repo and type `/reskin`.
2. The skill interviews you for business name, domain, tagline, palette, and fonts.
3. It fills `brand/brand.config.json` and runs `npm run apply-brand`.

**Font packages first.** `apply-brand` cannot install font packages. If you are changing fonts, install the `@fontsource` packages before running `apply-brand` or the build will fail:

```bash
npm install @fontsource/your-display-font @fontsource-variable/your-body-font
```

**Manual path (no skill session):**

1. Edit `brand/brand.config.json` with your brand values.
2. Install any new font packages (see above).
3. Run `npm run apply-brand` — deterministically rewrites `globals.css` tokens, `src/data/site.ts`, Studio theme props, and OG generator inputs, then regenerates `public/og-default.png`.
4. Run `npm run build` to verify nothing broke.

The shipped `brand/brand.config.json` encodes the neutral starter defaults, so `npm run apply-brand` on a fresh clone is a no-op. The OG image is non-deterministic (node-canvas rendering) and re-running produces a visually identical but byte-different file.

Full reference for the brand config shape, what `apply-brand` rewrites, and the `/reskin` skill's 8-step flow: `docs/brand/brand-system.md`.

## Enabling a module

Modules live under `modules/<name>/` and are off by default. Enabling one is a copy-and-register operation:

1. **Copy the module folder into the core dirs:**
   - `modules/<name>/studio/*` into `src/sanity/schemaTypes/` (schema files)
   - `modules/<name>/src/pages/*` into `src/pages/` (route files)
   - `modules/<name>/src/components/*` into `src/components/` (components)
   - The co-located query file `modules/<name>/src/lib/<name>Queries.ts` into `src/lib/` (GROQ queries). Nine of the ten modules ship a query file here. The `newsletter` module is the exception: it has no dedicated route or query file and is enabled by reading its `README.md` and embedding the component directly.

2. **Register the schema** in `src/sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts` and add the type to `src/sanity/structure.ts`.

3. **Wire navigation** — add the route to `Header.astro`'s `NAV_ITEMS` and to the footer links.

4. **Flip the visibility toggle** in Sanity Studio → Site Settings → Section visibility to enable the module's sections on the live site.

The co-located query file pattern means no hand-pasting of query functions into core `queries.ts`. Per-module guides are in `docs/modules/`.

After enabling, run `npm run typegen`, then rebuild. The Studio is embedded at `/studio` and ships with the site build, so there is no separate Studio deploy.

---

## Editing page content (section-driven pages)

The four core pages (home, about, services, process) and any custom `page` document render from a `pageBuilder` array in Sanity Studio. Editors add, reorder, and remove blocks without touching code.

**On a fresh clone with no Sanity project configured:** the site renders from code-defined defaults in `src/data/defaultSections.ts`. These defaults look like a real site, not blank pages.

**Once a Sanity project is connected:** seed the pages with `npm run seed`, then edit sections in Studio → the relevant page singleton → the "Sections" tab.

**Available block types:** the eleven general blocks (heroSection, richTextSection, imageTextSection, gallerySection, quoteSection, statSection, ctaBandSection, videoSection, spacerSection, logoStripSection, embedSection) plus the page-specific rich blocks (founderSection, servicesGridSection, testimonialsSection, processSection, faqSection, teamSection on Home; storySection, valuesSection, faqSection, teamSection on About; servicesGridSection, serviceAreaSection, guaranteeSection, faqSection on Services; processSection, faqSection on Process).

Blocks carry no background color field. `SectionRenderer` owns the alternating surface cadence automatically.

---

## Schema-change procedure

Any change to `src/sanity/schemaTypes/` must follow this sequence before committing:

1. Edit the schema file in `src/sanity/schemaTypes/`.
2. Run the gate. `npm run check` is the fast half (`astro check` + eslint) and
   `npm run check:full` is typegen, the build (which includes the embedded Studio) and
   the 432 unit tests. Add `npm run format:check`, `npm run check:links` and `npm test`
   (the Playwright suites: smoke, axe light, axe dark, reflow, on chromium and WebKit)
   for the whole thing, which is exactly what CI runs. Fix any failures before
   continuing. If the change could alter rendered markup, also run
   `npm run parity compare`.
   2b. If you added a dropdown/radio field whose exact value drives rendering, add its name to `NON_STEGA_FIELDS` in `src/lib/cms-preview.ts` in the same commit. Miss it and the block renders the wrong branch in the live preview only.
3. Commit the schema file AND the regenerated `src/lib/sanity.types.ts` together.
4. Deploy the site (`npm run deploy`). The Studio is embedded, so deploying the site publishes the schema with it; there is no separate Studio deploy step. Until the deploy lands, the live Studio shows "unknown fields" next to a "Remove field" prompt. **Never click "Remove field"** -- it deletes that field's data across every document, and it cannot be undone without a dataset restore.

---

## Deploy

The site is `output: 'static'` + `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter. Two paths:

### Auto-deploy via GitHub → Cloudflare

This is the normal path. Cloudflare watches `main` on GitHub.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "..."
git push origin main
```

Cloudflare detects the push, runs `npm run build` in their CI, and deploys the resulting `dist/` to the Worker. Takes about 1 to 2 minutes. Watch in the Cloudflare dashboard under Workers → [your-worker-name] → Deployments.

**Verify a deploy landed:**

```bash
# Wait until a specific marker is in the live HTML, then continue
until curl -s "https://your-worker.workers.dev/?cb=$(date +%s)" | grep -q 'SOMETHING_FROM_THIS_BUILD'; do sleep 5; done
echo "deploy live"
```

Use `until ! grep -q '...'` (with the bang) when waiting for something to be **removed** from the HTML — `until grep -qv` doesn't do what it looks like.

### Manual deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
# = npm run build && wrangler deploy
```

Only needed if you're testing a config change locally before committing, or if the auto-deploy webhook is broken.

### Sanity → Cloudflare deploy hook

The site is fully prerendered, so a Sanity content edit doesn't change the live HTML until a rebuild. A Sanity webhook is configured and hits a Cloudflare deploy hook. The flow:

1. Editor publishes a document in Sanity Studio
2. Sanity POSTs to the Cloudflare deploy hook
3. Cloudflare rebuilds + deploys in about 1 to 2 minutes
4. New content is live

If a content change isn't appearing on the live site after a few minutes:

- Check the webhook fired (Sanity Studio → Manage → API → Webhooks)
- Check the Cloudflare deploy hook is configured (Workers → Settings → Triggers → Deploy hooks)
- Try a manual `git push` to force a rebuild

### Rebuild webhook filter (recommended)

The webhook lives at manage.sanity.io → API → Webhooks. The recommended GROQ filter is a deny-list:

```
!(_id in path("drafts.**")) && !(_type in ["media.tag", "sanity.imageAsset", "sanity.fileAsset", "sanity.assetSourceData"])
```

This filter skips rebuilds triggered by draft saves and internal Sanity asset-management events (tagging an uploaded photo, rotating an image, etc.), which don't affect live HTML. New content types are covered automatically because the filter excludes only the named system types and lets everything else through. The old hand-maintained allow-list approach (explicitly listing every `_type` that should trigger a rebuild) silently dropped new types until a developer remembered to add them. The deny-list is safer: add a new schema type and it triggers rebuilds out of the box.

If the webhook currently has no filter or uses an allow-list, replace the filter with the deny-list above and save. No other webhook config changes are needed.

### Phased launch: turning sections on and off

The site has a section visibility system that lets you launch now and finish sections later, without leaving half-built pages on the live site.

**How to turn a section off:**

1. Open the Studio and click "Site Settings" in the left sidebar.
2. Click the "Section visibility" tab at the top of the document.
3. Find the toggle for the section you want to hide.
4. Flip it off.
5. Click the blue Publish button.
6. The site rebuilds in about 1 to 3 minutes. Once live, the section disappears from the menu, footer, homepage, and its own page redirects visitors to the home page instead.

**Important notes:**

- An unset toggle is the same as ON. You only see a change when you explicitly flip something to off and publish.
- Turning a section off does not delete or unpublish any content. All drafts and published documents are untouched. Turn the toggle back on and everything reappears after the next rebuild.
- Core pages (Home, About, Services, FAQ, Contact, Journal, Privacy, 404) are not toggleable and are always live.
- Detail pages for a toggled-off section (like `/portfolio/[slug]`) also disappear. The build skips generating those pages entirely, so they 404 cleanly.

**Why this is useful:** lets you launch the site while a section is still being built, without pressure to finish everything at once.

### Scheduled publishing

Sanity supports scheduling a document to go live at a future date and time.

**How to schedule a publish:**

1. Open the document you want to schedule.
2. Click the small arrow (chevron) to the right of the blue Publish button in the bottom bar.
3. Choose "Schedule publish" from the menu.
4. Pick the date and time. Times are local to your browser.
5. Click "Schedule." The document moves to a "Scheduled" state.

The live site rebuilds automatically when the scheduled publish fires. You can see, edit, or cancel scheduled items by going back to that document before the time fires.

**Note:** as of May 2026, the `@sanity/scheduled-publishing` plugin is incompatible with this Studio's React 19 dependency. Use the built-in document actions scheduling path above until the plugin is updated.

### Field comments

Sanity Studio includes a built-in Comments feature (the speech-bubble icon that appears next to field labels when you hover). Available by default in Sanity v5, no plugin or config needed.

**How to use it:**

1. Hover over any field label in a document.
2. Click the speech-bubble icon.
3. Type a question or note and click Submit.

Comments stay attached to the specific field until resolved. Comments do not affect published content in any way.

### Studio deploy

There isn't one. The Studio is **embedded at `/studio`** and built by `astro build`, so
deploying the site deploys the Studio. That is deliberate: a separately-deployed Studio
only updates when someone remembers to push it, and silently falls behind while pointing
at the same production data.

**Do not run `npx sanity deploy`.** It would publish a standalone Studio at
`<studioHost>.sanity.studio` and recreate exactly that split. `sanity.cli.ts` omits
`studioHost`/`deployment` to make it hard to do by accident.

Always run `npm run typegen` after schema changes so `src/lib/sanity.types.ts` is fresh,
then commit both files together. CI fails the build if the committed types are stale.

For the complete schema-change sequence, see the "Schema-change procedure" section above.

---

## Seed placeholder content

Seed scripts bootstrap document types with placeholder content for a fresh dataset. The reusable scripts in `scripts/` cover the core content types. Modules may include their own seed scripts documented in `docs/modules/`.

All seed scripts should be idempotent. Prefer `setIfMissing` (only fills empty fields) so existing editor customizations are not overwritten. Use `createOrReplace` only for canonical guide/reference content that should always match the seed file.

See the "Patch Sanity content programmatically" section below for the client setup pattern to copy.

**Important: seeded content is placeholder.** Before launch, replace all fabricated content (example press items, placeholder pricing, dummy affiliate URLs, sample guide PDFs) with real content.

## Before launch checklist

The items below apply to any project built on this starter. Replace the angle-bracketed placeholders with project-specific values.

**Wire identity (preferred: run /reskin or apply-brand):**

- [ ] Fill in `brand/brand.config.json` with the client's name, domain, tagline, palette, and font choices
- [ ] Install font packages first (`npm install @fontsource/...`) if changing from the defaults
- [ ] Run `npm run apply-brand` to cascade the brand config to `globals.css`, `site.ts`, Studio theme, and the OG image
- [ ] Place real logo files at the paths set in `brand/brand.config.json` → `logoPaths` (the script does not copy files)
- [ ] Replace `public/favicon.svg` with the project's favicon
- [ ] See `docs/brand/brand-system.md` for full detail on the reskin system

**Wire Sanity:**

- [ ] Create Sanity project; set `PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`, `PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` in `.env` and Cloudflare → Workers → Variables
- [ ] Set `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` (scoped read token from Sanity Manage → API → Tokens)
- [ ] Set `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN` in `.env` locally for running seed/patch scripts
- [ ] Deploy the site (`npm run deploy`) -- this publishes the embedded Studio at `/studio` too
- [ ] Allow the origins on the Sanity project's CORS list: `npx sanity cors add https://<your-worker>.workers.dev --credentials` (and `http://localhost:4321` for local work). Without this the embedded Studio cannot sign in.
- [ ] Set the `SANITY_TOKEN` Worker secret for the live preview: `npx wrangler secret put SANITY_TOKEN` (a Viewer token with draft read access). Locally it goes in `.dev.vars`; see `.dev.vars.example`.
- [ ] Configure the Sanity → Cloudflare rebuild webhook with the deny-list filter (see above)

**Wire external services:**

- [ ] Web3Forms: create a form, set the access key in the contact form component
- [ ] Calendly: set `PUBLIC_CALENDLY_URL` env var to the real booking URL
- [ ] Cloudflare Web Analytics: create a site, add the token to `wrangler.jsonc`

**Seed + populate content:**

- [ ] Run applicable seed scripts for a fresh dataset
- [ ] Replace all placeholder/sample content with real content before launch
- [ ] Toggle off any modules that are not yet ready (via Site Settings → Section visibility in Studio)

**Pre-flight validation:**

- [ ] Lighthouse: Performance 95+, Accessibility 100, Best Practices 100, SEO 100 on the deployed Cloudflare URL
- [ ] Contact form test submission reaches the correct inbox
- [ ] All external links open in a new tab with correct `rel` attributes
- [ ] Sitemap submitted to Google Search Console

## Patch Sanity content programmatically

For one-off content updates (backfilling new fields, fixing typos across many docs), write a script in `scripts/`. Pattern:

```js
import { createClient } from '@sanity/client';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { dirname, resolve } from 'node:path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';

const __dirname = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
const root = resolve(__dirname, '..');

const env = Object.fromEntries(
  readFileSync(resolve(root, '.env'), 'utf-8')
    .split('\n')
    .filter((l) => l && !l.startsWith('#') && l.includes('='))
    .map((l) => {
      const [k, ...v] = l.split('=');
      return [k.trim(), v.join('=').trim()];
    }),
);

const client = createClient({
  projectId: env.PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID,
  dataset: env.PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET ?? 'production',
  apiVersion: env.PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION ?? '2026-05-01',
  useCdn: false,
  token: env.SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN,
});

// ... your patch logic ...
```

Then `node scripts/your-script.mjs`.

**Idempotency.** Always make patch scripts re-runnable. Use `setIfMissing` (only fills empty fields) or check the current value before writing.

**Portable Text blocks** need `_key` (use `randomUUID()`), `_type: 'block'`, `style` (e.g. `'normal'`, `'h2'`), `markDefs: []`, and `children` with their own `_key`.

**Key gotcha when editing page copy:** most page singleton fields already have Sanity content, so changing a code fallback in an Astro page does NOT change the live site — the Sanity value wins. To change displayed copy on a populated field you must patch Sanity. Only genuinely-empty fields render their code fallback.

**Annotation cleanup:** Sanity Canvas (AI-assisted drafting) sometimes lets prefix annotations like `[NEW per audit, softer framing] …` or `[TODO: fill in …]` slip into published content. `scripts/strip-editor-annotations.mjs` scans every doc for these patterns:

```bash
node scripts/strip-editor-annotations.mjs           # dry-run (default)
node scripts/strip-editor-annotations.mjs --apply   # actually patch
```

Re-run after large Canvas batches.

## Run Lighthouse / performance audits

If a regression is suspected:

```bash
# Build locally to check bundle sizes
npm run build
# Astro logs every chunk + image emit in the build output.

# Quick diff between branches
git diff main HEAD -- src/components src/pages
```

For end-to-end Lighthouse runs against the deployed site, use Chrome DevTools' bundled Lighthouse or the chrome-devtools MCP. The MCP path:

```
mcp__plugin_chrome-devtools-mcp_chrome-devtools__navigate_page → URL
mcp__plugin_chrome-devtools-mcp_chrome-devtools__emulate → viewport "360x640x1.875,mobile,touch" + colorScheme light
mcp__plugin_chrome-devtools-mcp_chrome-devtools__lighthouse_audit → device "mobile"
```

Note: the MCP lighthouse_audit only returns Accessibility / BP / SEO / Agentic. For Performance metrics use `performance_start_trace` which gives LCP / CLS / breakdown.

**Always test on the workers.dev URL,** not the live production domain until DNS is cut over.

### Common diagnostic findings (most are unscored)

| Lighthouse flag                              | What it's actually saying                                     | Fix                                                                                                            |

## Regenerate logos

Source files live in `src/assets/`. To regenerate from a source image:

```bash
# 1. Build new variants from a source JPG
node scripts/generate-logo-variants.mjs
# OR with a specific source file:
node scripts/generate-logo-variants.mjs your-logo.jpg

# 2. Optimize before Astro picks them up
node scripts/optimize-logo-files.mjs
```

The PNGs land in `src/assets/` (NOT `public/`) so Astro's `<Image>` / `getImage()` pipeline can emit content-hashed WebPs. `Header.astro` and `Footer.astro` read these via `getImage()`.

**Don't move them back to `public/`** — Astro can't touch `public/` files and you'd lose the WebP conversion + content-hashing.

## Common Sanity tasks

### Add a new field to a page singleton

1. Edit `src/sanity/schemaTypes/<page>.ts` — add `defineField(...)`.
2. `npm run typegen` (regenerates `src/lib/sanity.types.ts`).
3. Add the field to the GROQ projection in `src/lib/queries.ts` (for non-section fields) or to `sectionsProjection()` if it is inside a section block.
4. Use the field in the corresponding Astro page or section component with a sensible fallback.
5. Write a backfill script in `scripts/` to set the value on the existing production doc (use `setIfMissing` so future editor changes aren't clobbered).
6. `npm run build` to confirm the site and the embedded Studio build clean.
7. Commit the schema file and the regenerated `src/lib/sanity.types.ts` together, then push. The deploy publishes the Studio along with the site.

See the full schema-change procedure above (in the "Schema-change procedure" section) for the complete order of operations.

## Common gotchas (the ones that have bitten at least once)

| Symptom                                                 | Cause                                                                                        | Fix                                                                                                                                |

| Theme reverts to light after clicking a nav link        | View Transitions reset html className on swap                                                | The anti-FOUC script in BaseLayout listens for `astro:after-swap` and re-applies. Don't remove that listener.                      |
| Footer logo renders broken / empty                      | Footer is below first paint, head script ran before footer img existed in DOM                | Same anti-FOUC script has a `DOMContentLoaded` listener for exactly this. Don't remove.                                            |
| Sanity image broken with CORS error                     | `crossorigin="anonymous"` was added to a `<img>` pointing at `cdn.sanity.io`                 | Remove the `crossorigin` attribute. Sanity CDN doesn't send Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers.                                   |
| Inline scripts blocked, theme/Lenis/polish all break    | Someone enabled `security.csp` in `astro.config.mjs`                                         | Remove the config block. See CLAUDE.md → Stack → Astro config don'ts.                                                              |

| `text-link` className override on white BG doesn't work | Tailwind v4 sorts utilities alphabetically; `text-link` beats `text-bg` later in the cascade | Add a component prop (like `CtaLink`'s `onDark`) instead of trying to override via className.                                      |
| Eyebrow text fails Lighthouse contrast on light mode    | `text-foreground/65` on light backgrounds = ~3.6:1 (fails AA)                                | Bump to `text-foreground/80` (~5.4:1, passes). Don't add new `/65` instances on muted/background surfaces.                         |
| TOC sidebar empty on a long-form post                   | No h2/h3/h4 in the body                                                                      | Add headings in Sanity. `extractHeadings()` only sees those three levels.                                                          |
| Playwright `fullPage` screenshot is mostly blank        | `[data-reveal]` elements start at `opacity: 0` until the IntersectionObserver fires          | `page.evaluate(() => document.querySelectorAll('[data-reveal]').forEach(el => el.classList.add('is-visible')))` before screenshot. |
| Build fails on fresh clone with Sanity query errors     | `PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` is not set                                                        | Expected — `sanityFetch` returns fallbacks when unconfigured. Set the env var to connect a real project.                           |
| Image optimizer path mismatch after adapter upgrade     | `@astrojs/cloudflare` upgraded past `13.5.5`                                                 | Revert to exactly `13.5.5`. See CLAUDE.md gotcha #8.                                                                               |
| Featured section shows wrong item as the hero           | Falling back to date-based default                                                           | Toggle `featured: true` on the item to pin. Sections sort `featured desc, publishedAt desc`.                                       |

## Useful one-liners

```bash
# Find every <img> in the codebase
# (Sanity-sourced imgs are handled by SanityImage.astro; local ones use Astro <Image>)
grep -rn '<img' src/

# Find every client: directive (Astro hydration audit)
grep -rn 'client:' src/

# Check what's actually deployed on the workers URL
curl -s "https://your-worker.workers.dev/?cb=$(date +%s)" | grep -oE 'SOMETHING_TO_LOOK_FOR'
```

---

## When something feels wrong

1. **Check the deployed workers URL first**, not localhost — the bug might already be fixed and just hasn't been redeployed.
2. **Open Chrome DevTools and check Console + Network** — most of the "weird" bugs in this codebase have been either CSP violations, CORS issues, or theme/View Transitions interaction. All show up loudly in DevTools.
3. **Read CLAUDE.md → relevant section** before changing anything. The non-obvious fixes are documented; reverting them tends to re-break the same bugs.
4. **Run `npm run build` locally** — Astro's build output catches a lot (missing imports, schema mismatches, image-pipeline errors).
5. **Diff against the last known-good commit** — `git log --oneline -20` then `git diff <hash>..HEAD -- src/path`.
