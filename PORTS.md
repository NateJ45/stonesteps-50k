# PORTS.md - the shared-improvement registry for the site family

This starter is the **library of record** for improvements that generalize across the
Astro + Sanity + Cloudflare sites built from it. When a fix stops being about one
client and becomes a technique, it gets written down here as a **port card**, and its
canonical implementation lives in this repo.

A port card is one dated entry describing a single portable improvement: what it is,
why it exists (the bug or the cost that produced it), where the canonical copy lives,
how to install it in a site, and what has to be adapted per site. The applied-to matrix
above the cards is the machine-checkable half: which repo in the family currently has
it.

**Docs-in-sync clause.** An improvement that generalizes gets a card **in the same
commit that generalizes it**. Not a follow-up, not a TODO. A card written a week later
is a card written from memory, and the reason a technique exists is the part that
decays fastest. The same rule applies in reverse: when a card's real-world status
changes (a site adopts it, a card is superseded), the matrix row moves in that commit.

## Canonical files and the drift check

Files this repo owns carry a marker on their first line, adapted to the file's comment
syntax:

```
// PORTABLE: canonical copy - ncs-astro-sanity-starter is the library of record for this file
```

`node scripts/sync-check.mjs [site-repo]` walks a site repo, finds every marked file,
and diffs it against this starter's copy of the same relative path. It prints
`SAME` / `DRIFT` / `MISSING-IN-STARTER` per file with a summary, and exits 1 on any
drift. Line endings are normalized (this family is authored on Windows and built on
Linux CI), everything else is byte-exact. Locate the starter with `NCS_STARTER_DIR`,
or leave it to find a sibling `ncs-astro-sanity-starter` directory. It is
dependency-free, so it runs in any repo in the family whatever that repo has installed.

Run it from the starter against itself for a self-check (everything must be `SAME`),
and from each site during that site's sync session.

**Most sites do not have the marker yet.** As of 2026-08-27 only this starter's copies
carried it, so a cross-check from a site reported "no marked files found" rather than
drift. Adding the marker line to a site's already-ported copies is the first act of that
site's sync session. presacademy needs one: it is the source of most of these files and
none of its copies are marked. WCP has had its session: 23 marked files as of
2026-09-06, all `SAME`.

**The marker is opt-in and one-way, so it proves nothing about what it does not cover.**
A file with no marker is not thereby non-portable; it has simply never been looked at.
That is what a harvest audit is for: read a site's unmarked files, decide portable /
site-specific / dead for each, and either port the wins or write down why not. The
first one (WCP, 2026-09-06) is recorded in the harvest notes under the cards it
touched.

## Applied-to matrix

`yes` = present and current. `partial` = an ancestor or divergent form of the same idea,
or present but not wired into that repo's gate. `no` = absent. `yes` = a session
is installing it as of the date on the card.

Rows for repos that have adopted nothing still exist on purpose: a future sweep ticks
cells instead of inventing the table again.

Card 28's starter cell reads `partial` for the same reason card 26's does, and the two
have to be read together: this template forbids a per-block colour field, so the band
card that is a third of that layer elsewhere has nothing here to write to and was
deliberately not built. The two TEXT controls landed in full. See the card.

## Card 1: with-workerd build wrapper

**Dated 2026-08-25 (presacademy), ported to the starter 2026-08-27.**
**Canonical:** `scripts/with-workerd.mjs`

On Astro 7 with `@astrojs/cloudflare` 14, `astro build` prerenders static pages by
booting workerd through `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`. On Windows, the workerd binary that
plugin pins dies instantly with `*** std::terminate() called with no exception` behind
a `MiniflareCoreError [ERR_RUNTIME_FAILURE]`. The newer workerd bundled inside wrangler
runs the identical config fine. The wrapper finds wrangler's copy and sets
`MINIFLARE_WORKERD_PATH` before handing off, so `npm run build` (and therefore
`npm run deploy`) works on a Windows machine.

Deliberately narrow: Windows only, never overrides an explicit
`MINIFLARE_WORKERD_PATH`, and no-ops when wrangler's binary is absent. Linux CI stays on
the stock path.

**Status in the starter:** installed and **wired** as of 2026-08-28, when this repo took
the Astro 7 / adapter 14 upgrade: `"build": "node scripts/with-workerd.mjs astro build"`.
(Before that it sat here as a no-op safety net, because adapter 13.5.5 did not route the
prerender through the vite plugin and the crash could not occur.)

**Per-site adaptation:** none. Retire the wrapper when the plugin's pinned workerd
starts on Windows again.

## Card 2: free-dist prebuild unlock

**Dated 2026-08-26 (presacademy), ported to the starter 2026-08-27.**
**Canonical:** `scripts/free-dist.mjs`

A still-running `wrangler dev` / `astro preview` / `http-server` holds a handle on
`dist/`. Astro empties dist at the start of every build, so the next build dies with
`EPERM, Permission denied: \\?\...\dist\client`. It reads like a permissions problem and
is really "something is still serving the last build". This cost two real deploys in one
day.

The script kills only `node.exe` / `workerd.exe` processes whose command line mentions
**both** this project's directory **and** a known dev server, and prints every PID it
stops. Windows only, so Linux CI is untouched.

**Genericization done on the port:** the project root comes from the script's own
location (`import.meta.url` -> `../`), so a copy dropped in any repo matches that repo's
processes and nothing else, with no edit. The command-line match was switched from
PowerShell's `-like` to an ordinal case-insensitive `IndexOf`: `-like` treats `[` and `]`
as wildcard character classes, so a checkout path containing brackets would silently
match nothing.

**Status in the starter:** installed, exposed as `npm run free-dist`, **not** wired as a
`prebuild` hook. Running PowerShell on every build is a behavior change a downstream
project should opt into. To make it automatic:
`"prebuild": "node scripts/free-dist.mjs"`.

## Card 3: page-parity harness

**Dated 2026-08-26 (presacademy), ported and parameterized 2026-08-27.**
**Canonical:** `scripts/page-parity.mjs`, baselines in `scripts/.parity/`

Captures each built page's rendered HTML, then diffs a later build against that
snapshot. Built for a page-builder conversion where the promise was "same pixels", but
it earns its place on any change that is supposed to be render-neutral: extracting a
component, reordering imports, swapping a wrapper, bumping a dependency.

Neither mode builds. The caller builds; the script reads existing output. That keeps it
fast to re-run, keeps build noise out of the diff, and lets capture and compare be
pointed at the same artifacts while debugging the normalizer itself.

The normalizer strips exactly four classes of build-varying value and leaves everything
else byte-faithful: `/_astro/` content hashes, Astro's generated `data-astro-cid-*` and
transition-scope hashes, the `<astro-island>` render-order `prefix`, and whitespace
between tags. Text, classes, ids, aria, inline styles and JSON-LD are all compared.

**Parameterization done on the port:** the built-HTML root is auto-detected
(`dist/client` when it holds an index.html, which is the adapter 14 shape, else `dist`,
the adapter 13 shape) and can be overridden with `PARITY_DIST`. The chosen root prints
on every run so a snapshot is never silently taken against the wrong tree. Routes are
auto-discovered by walking the html root for `.html` files (asset directories skipped,
sorted for determinism), so a fresh clone needs no edit; a project wanting a fixed
plan-ordered subset fills in the `PAGES` constant and discovery switches off.

**Proof in this repo (2026-08-27):** `npm run build`, capture (9 routes: home, about,
services, process, faq, contact, journal, privacy, 404), `npm run build` again, compare
-> 9/9 PASS. Baselines committed under `scripts/.parity/`.

`npm run parity list | capture | compare [page]`.

**Per-site adaptation:** re-capture baselines on first install, and again whenever a
markup change is intended (say so in the commit message). Nested routes are stored with
`/` flattened to `__` in the snapshot filename.

## Card 4: sanity-lib seed/patch plumbing

**Dated 2026-08-25 (presacademy, distilled from WCP's `patch-lib.mjs` +
`pagebuilder-lib.mjs`), ported 2026-08-27.**
**Canonical:** `scripts/lib/sanity-lib.mjs`

The three things every Sanity seed or patch script re-invents, in one import: a
token-authed client built from the root `.env`; a **dry-run-by-default apply gate**
(scripts print exactly what they would change and write nothing without `--apply`); and
Portable Text builders, `_key` generation, and an **idempotent** asset uploader that
caches asset ids in `scripts/.asset-map.json` so a re-run never re-uploads.

The dry-run gate is the load-bearing part. These scripts mutate a live dataset, often
against a quota, and the default has to be "show me".

**Reconciliation done on the port:** presacademy's copy carried its own inline `.env`
parser. This starter already ships `scripts/lib/loadEnv.mjs`, so the duplicate is gone
and sanity-lib imports loadEnv. loadEnv is the keeper because it is stricter: it enforces
a KEY shape, strips inline `# comments` from bare values, takes quoted values literally,
and gives `process.env` precedence. The looser parser accepted `KEY=value # note` and put
the comment inside the token, which is the shape of the `.env`-quoted-token 401 that cost
a WCP session. A site porting sanity-lib must bring `loadEnv.mjs` with it, or repoint the
import at its own equivalent; that is the file's only dependency beyond `@sanity/client`.

**Per-site adaptation:** `apiVersion` and the env variable names. Add
`scripts/.asset-map.json` to `.gitignore` (done here).

**Related gotchas worth carrying:** a quoted token in `.env` produced a 401 that looked
like a permissions problem; and Sanity refuses to delete a document that other documents
still reference, so cleanup scripts must unlink before deleting.

## Card 5: stale-types CI guard

**Dated 2026-08-27 (pattern from presacademy's `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).**
**Canonical:** the "Fail if committed Sanity types are stale" step in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`

`npm run build` does not chain typegen, so `src/lib/sanity.types.ts` is committed by
hand after every schema change, and sooner or later it is not. presacademy shipped types
describing a schema that no longer existed, on a green build, on 2026-06-14. The guard is
four lines: right after CI's own `npm run typegen`, fail if that regeneration produced a
git diff.

```yaml
- name: Fail if committed Sanity types are stale
  run: |
    if ! git diff --quiet -- src/lib/sanity.types.ts; then
      echo "::error::src/lib/sanity.types.ts is out of date. Run 'npm run typegen' and commit the result."
      git --no-pager diff -- src/lib/sanity.types.ts
      exit 1
    fi
```

**Per-site adaptation:** the path to the generated types file, and it must sit after
whatever step runs typegen. Verified against this repo 2026-08-27: `npm run typegen`
reproduces the committed file exactly (the only local difference is line endings, which
git normalizes, so the check is clean on Linux CI).

## Card 6: Nightly Sanity backup workflow

**Dated 2026-08-27, ENCRYPTION ADDED 2026-09-01 (pattern from
`presacademy/.github/workflows/sanity-backup.yml`, encryption from
`wcp-website` commit 73cfe3c).**
**Canonical:** not yet installed in the starter. Reference implementation is
presacademy's workflow (which now carries the encrypted version); the
church-starter's template copy was upgraded to the encrypted version the same
day. wcp-website also runs the encrypted version (it is where the pattern
landed first, commit 73cfe3c).

A nightly `sanity dataset export` of production (documents plus assets), ENCRYPTED,
then uploaded as a workflow artifact, so a bad mutation or an accidental Studio
"Remove field" is always recoverable. Structured as a `gate` job that checks whether
BOTH secrets are set — `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN` and `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` — and an `export`
job gated on it, so the workflow is safe to commit before the secrets exist.

**The encryption is load-bearing on public repos — never port the pre-2026-09-01
plaintext version.** Workflow artifacts on a PUBLIC repo are downloadable by any
logged-in GitHub user, and most of this family is public, so an unencrypted dataset
artifact publishes the client's content (directories, family details, whatever the
dataset holds). The pattern: the gate refuses to export at all when
`BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` is missing (warn + skip, never a plaintext upload), and the
export is encrypted before upload with
`openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 200000 -salt -pass env:BACKUP_PASSPHRASE`,
uploading only the `.enc`. Restore prepends one decrypt step (`openssl enc -d` with
the same flags). The passphrase must ALSO live outside GitHub, somewhere the client
can find it — GitHub never shows a secret again, and a backup nobody can decrypt is
no backup.

**The schedule-disabled-until-secret pattern.** presacademy commented its `schedule:`
block out with the reason preserved in the file: the token was never set, so the daily
gate job billed a minute a day just to log "skipping". `workflow_dispatch` stays on, so
manual runs still work, and uncommenting one line activates it. Record the decision in
the file, not only in a commit message, so the next person knows it was deliberate.

**Public repos can leave the schedule on.** GitHub Actions minutes are free on public
repositories, so the billing argument that justified disabling the schedule does not
apply to them. Most of this family is public (all eight were confirmed public
2026-07-14). Disable the schedule for private repos, or where the secret genuinely will
not exist for months; otherwise leave it running.

**Per-site adaptation:** the public Sanity project id and dataset name (the id is not a
secret, it ships in the client bundle), the retention window, the restore steps
(including the decrypt step) in that repo's ops doc, and where the off-GitHub copy of
`BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` is kept for that client.

## Card 7: Uptime workflow

**Dated 2026-08-27 (pattern from `presacademy/.github/workflows/uptime.yml`).**
**Canonical:** not yet installed in the starter. Reference implementation is
presacademy's workflow.

Hourly `curl` of a handful of key routes, failing the run if any does not return 200; a
failed run notifies through GitHub. Activated by a `SITE_URL` **repo variable** (not a
secret) so it never false-alarms before launch: with the variable unset it logs a warning
and exits 0.

Same schedule-disabled-until-configured pattern and the same public-repo exception as
Card 6. GitHub's scheduler is best-effort and can be delayed under load, so this is a
safety net, not monitoring. For real monitoring point a dedicated service at the
homepage; UptimeRobot's free tier is enough.

**Per-site adaptation:** the route list. Pick routes that exercise different data paths
(a CMS-driven page, a collection index, a static legal page), not three variations of
the homepage.

## Card 8: Playwright + axe + 320-1440 reflow suite

**Dated 2026-08-27. Canonical example: `presacademy/tests/`** (`smoke.spec.ts`,
`a11y.spec.ts`, `a11y-dark.spec.ts`, `reflow.spec.ts`, `routes.ts`, `helpers.ts`).
Not installed in the starter.

Four specs over one shared route list: smoke (every route renders, no console errors),
axe in light, axe in **dark** as a separate sweep, and a reflow sweep that loads every
route at every width in the 320-1440 band and fails on horizontal overflow.

The shape matters more than the code. A single route list (`routes.ts`) feeding all four
specs is what keeps the suite honest when a route is added. The dark sweep is separate
because axe audits the resting DOM and a theme swap is a different resting DOM. The
reflow band starts at **320px** because WCAG 1.4.10 does, and a single mobile screenshot
at 375 does not discharge it: WCP's 2026-07-14 audit swept 752 route-by-width
combinations and the findings were all in places no one had screenshotted. CI later swept
768 / 1024 / 1440 as well, on the same principle.

**reid-design-site already has a variant of this suite whose CI never runs it.** A suite
that does not run is worse than no suite: it reports green by being absent from the
pipeline. Fixing that wiring is the reid row's first job, not writing new tests.

**Per-site adaptation:** the route list, the a11y tag filter (WCP's `a11y-tag-filter`
gotcha: filtering to `wcag2a` alone quietly drops the AA rules), and the settle helper
that waits out animation before an axe pass.

## Card 9: contrast.ts + theme-token gate

**Dated 2026-08-27 (from presacademy `src/lib/contrast.ts`, itself the port of a WCP
gate).**
**Canonical:** `src/lib/contrast.ts` (the maths) and `src/lib/css-tokens.ts` (the
reading), with `src/lib/theme-tokens.test.ts` as the starter's own application of them.

WCAG 2.x contrast math as a tiny unit-testable module: `hexToRgb`, `relativeLuminance`,
`contrastRatio`, `flatten` (compositing a translucent colour over its real backdrop,
which is what a dark theme's white-at-12% hairline actually is), and the AA thresholds
named as constants so a failure reads as intent instead of a magic number.

It exists because this bug class is invisible to every other gate. An invisible focus
ring, a border under 3:1, a button with no visible edge: axe has no rule for
focus-indicator or custom-border contrast, and an axe sweep audits the resting DOM only.
In WCP those all shipped on a green build with Lighthouse at 100.

`hexToRgb` throws on anything it cannot parse, on purpose: a silently-zero colour makes a
contrast test pass for the wrong reason.

**The theme-token gate applied here.** `npm run apply-brand` rewrites the `@theme`
palette in `globals.css` from `brand/brand.config.json`, and nothing else notices when a
new project's palette pushes body text under 4.5:1. `theme-tokens.test.ts` parses the
real hex tokens out of `globals.css` and asserts the pairs the design system actually
renders (ink and both slate tones on both paper surfaces, white reversed out of the dark
brand surfaces), so a bad reskin fails `npm test` before anyone looks at a screenshot.

Scope is the light `@theme` block only. The shadcn `:root` / `.dark` overrides are
authored in oklch with alpha and would need a colour-space conversion; that is a bigger
job and is deliberately not attempted. Two token pairs are deliberately **not** asserted
(`--color-secondary` and `--color-border-soft` on the paper surfaces): they are hairline
dividers near 2:1 by design, not UI component boundaries. Any token used for a focus ring
or a control edge must be added to the test with `AA_NON_TEXT`.

**Per-site adaptation:** the token names and the pair list. Also worth carrying: WCP's
measured accessible "ink" replacement shades, which solved the same problem by moving the
palette rather than the pairs.

**Harvest note (2026-09-06).** WCP's `src/lib/contrast.ts` is now byte-identical to this
one and carries the marker, so the matrix row is `yes` rather than `partial`. The audit
that did that turned up one thing worth writing down, and it is about THIS repo, not WCP.

There are two token extractors in this starter and they are not the same quality. The
one in `theme-tokens.test.ts` is a single unscoped `matchAll` for `--color-*: #hex`
across the whole of `globals.css`. It is not scoped to a block, so it keeps the LAST
declaration of each token wherever it appears, and it cannot see a `var(--other)` alias
at all. Today it happens to be correct, because all ten hex `--color-*` declarations sit
inside the one `@theme` block. The day anyone writes a hex `--color-*` into `.dark` or
`@theme inline`, that test silently starts measuring the dark value and asserting it as
a light pair, and it will still pass, which is the worst failure mode a gate has.

The extractor in `surfaces.test.ts` is the correct one: brace-counted so a nested rule
cannot end a block early, `@theme` / `@theme inline` / `:root` read as the light scope
and `.dark` as the dark one, `var()` aliases followed to a concrete hex. WCP's
`theme-tokens.test.ts` is the same design and covers both themes, which is why card 26
rule 2 already describes the technique as if it were universal here. It is not: card 9's
own file predates it.

The fix is to lift that extractor into one shared helper and have `theme-tokens.test.ts`
use it. Deliberately NOT done in the audit commit: it is a real change to a gate, the two
test files run in different runners across the family, and it deserves its own session
rather than riding along with a marker sync.

### The reader is one module now (2026-09-06)

**Canonical:** `src/lib/css-tokens.ts`. `theme-tokens.test.ts` and `surfaces.test.ts`
both import it, and so does WCP's Vitest fork.

**The bug was demonstrated before it was fixed, because "it passes" is not evidence a
gate works.** With `--color-primary-dark: #2a2d31` planted in the `.dark` block of
`globals.css`, the old file passed 12 of 12 while silently measuring the dark value:
`--color-primary-dark` on `--color-bg` read 13.36:1 instead of 8.17:1, on
`--color-bg-soft` 12.54:1 instead of 7.67:1, and white on `--color-primary-dark` 13.83:1
instead of 8.46:1. Three asserted numbers wrong, build green. The same plant now fails
the new gate by name. Not a hypothetical, and not a proof anyone should skip: the
one-line reproduction is the whole reason this card is trustworthy.

**Scope is the caller's choice, not the module's.** There is no single right answer to
"the light scope" in this stylesheet, which is why the two gates cannot simply share one
reader with one built-in scope. `BRAND_SCOPE` is a bare `@theme`: the brand palette
`apply-brand` rewrites, and the only thing this card's gate asks about. `LIGHT_SCOPE`
adds `@theme inline` and `:root`: what a shadcn semantic token actually resolves to on
the page, which is what card 26's `surfaces.test.ts` asks about. They genuinely differ,
because `@theme inline` re-points `--color-accent` at `var(--accent)` on purpose, so
bare `text-accent` is theme-aware and is NOT the palette ink. A shared reader that
silently picked one of those would have re-created the same class of bug in a new place.

**Light-only stays deliberate and is no longer a limitation of the reader.** The pairs
this gate asserts are unchanged, and every asserted value is unchanged; the dark half of
the question is already measured, in both themes, by `surfaces.test.ts`.

**Three of the new tests measure no colour at all.** They assert the scope premise: that
the `@theme` block was found and holds the palette, that `.dark` declares none of the
names this gate measures as light, and that the only later light-scope override of an
asserted token is the recorded `--color-accent` one. A gate that can be wrong about
WHICH declaration it read has to check that first, before any threshold means anything.

**Family status of the extractor, audited 2026-09-06.** Every repo has a theme-token
gate; they are not the same gate. `shared` means it imports `css-tokens.ts`.

| repo                | theme-tokens.test.ts        | surfaces.test.ts |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| starter             | shared                      | shared           |
| wcp                 | shared (Vitest, own pairs)  | n/a              |
| presacademy         | own copy, scoped + aliases  | own copy, same   |
| ncs-church-starter  | unscoped hex-only (the bug) | scoped + aliases |
| mas-monograms       | unscoped hex-only (the bug) | n/a              |
| 2ndpreschicago      | unscoped hex-only (the bug) | n/a              |
| reid-design-site    | per-block, but hex-only     | n/a              |
| nixoncreativestudio | per-block, but hex-only     | n/a              |

Three repos carry the exact silent-failure this session fixed. Two more are scoped
correctly but alias-blind, which is the failure WCP's own gate was bitten by and records
in its header: a `.dark` block that re-points a token with `var(--other)` is invisible to
them, so they fall through to the light value and measure the wrong colour in dark.
presacademy has the good logic twice and needs consolidating, not fixing.

Those five ports are NOT done here, and the reason is specific rather than a shrug. Each
site's `globals.css` puts its palette in a different place, so choosing `BRAND_SCOPE`
against `LIGHT_SCOPE` per gate is a judgement per repo, and getting it wrong is exactly
the silent failure being fixed. `ncs-church-starter`'s `staging` is also behind its
`main`, so the family's staging-only push rule does not currently hold there. Do them a
repo at a time, and plant the declaration and watch the old gate pass before replacing
it: that is the acceptance test for this card.

**Do not chase byte-identity on the test files.** `css-tokens.ts` is canonical and
marked. `theme-tokens.test.ts` is not, in any repo: the runner (`node --test` here,
Vitest in WCP and reid) and the pairs are legitimately per-site, and WCP's fork carries
its own documented rationale in its header. Sharing the reader is the whole of what
travels.

## Card 10: Embedded-studio live-preview stack

**Dated 2026-08-27. Canonical example: presacademy** (`src/pages/preview/live.ts`,
`src/lib/preview-auth.ts`, `src/lib/cms-preview.ts`,
`src/sanity/components/PreviewNavigator.tsx`) and WCP's equivalent. Not installed in the
starter.

Five parts that only work together: Sanity's `presentationTool` in the Studio config; an
SSE endpoint (`/preview/live`) proxying Sanity's listen API so edits stream to the
preview iframe; a fingerprint-based `preview-auth` so the draft-reading route cannot be
hit by the public; a `NON_STEGA_FIELDS` list; and a `PreviewNavigator` document view.

**`NON_STEGA_FIELDS` is not optional.** Stega hides roughly 1KB of invisible markers
inside every string it touches, so `tone === 'chapel'` is `false` on an encoded value and
the component silently takes the wrong branch **in preview only**. Every enum that drives
rendering must be excluded. Add any new logic-driving dropdown field to that list the day
you add the field.

### Hard warning 1: one package, or `resolve.dedupe`

A nested `studio/` package means **two node_modules trees**. The Studio shell resolves
`sanity` / `styled-components` / `@sanity/ui` from the root; every file under `studio/`
resolves them from `studio/node_modules`. Same pinned versions, two module instances, two
React contexts. The ThemeProvider mounted by one styled-components is invisible to
`useTheme` in the other, so the desk dies on its first custom-component render
(styled-components error #18, then `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'v2')`)
while the login screen, which is core code only, renders fine. This was the actual cause
of presacademy's 2026-08-26 production Studio crashes, behind four failed fixes. WCP never
hit it because its studio lives in the same package as the site.

Two fixes: fold the studio into the root package (what presacademy did), or set
`resolve.dedupe`. Keep the dedupe either way. The verification that matters is a disk
audit, not a lockfile read: `find node_modules studio/node_modules -path
"*@sanity/ui/package.json"` must print exactly **one** line. `@sanity/icons` is
deliberately **not** deduped (sanity core wants v5, `@sanity/ui` v3 wants v3.8; icons are
stateless so duplication is harmless, and deduping them broke the build on a missing v5
`CogIcon`).

### Hard warning 2: exact resolved versions, and the family's version skew

The Sanity stack is pinned to a combination known to work **together**, and bumping one
in isolation breaks it. The working set as of the phase-1 migration (2026-09-06): `sanity`
6.9.1, `@sanity/vision` 6.9.1, `@sanity/ui` **3.5.4**, `@sanity/client` 7.26.2,
`@sanity/visual-editing` 5.7.3, `@sanity/preview-url-secret` 4.1.5, `styled-components`
6.4.3, `react` / `react-dom` / `react-is` 19.2.7, plus `sanity-plugin-media` 5.0.11,
`sanity-plugin-utils` 2.0.6 (pinned through `overrides`; the default 2.0.17 drags in
`@sanity/ui` v4) and `sanity-plugin-asset-source-unsplash` 7.0.15.

**`sanity` 6.9.2 is the wall.** A PATCH release moved the core to `@sanity/ui` 4, which is
a genuine migration (ESM only, a required `@sanity/ui/styles.css` import, heavy components
moved to subpaths, deprecated props removed). Phase 1 stops at 6.9.1 on purpose. The exact
pins in `package.json` are what stop npm resolving straight through that boundary.

"Latest v3" is not close enough on the OLD core either. Pinning `@sanity/ui` to 3.5.3
against `sanity` 6.4.0 cleared error #18 and then failed differently, `TypeError: Cannot
read properties of undefined (reading 'v2')` from inside styled-components'
`generateAndInjectStyles`, because 6.4.0 expected the 3.3.x theme shape. That pairing is
now history (the core moved with the UI), but the lesson stands: any Sanity dependency
change must be checked against a sibling repo's **resolved** versions, not its semver
ranges.

Phase-1 notes worth carrying to the next repo. `@sanity/visual-editing` appears as a
dependency AND in `overrides`; edit both in the same pass or npm refuses the whole install
with `EOVERRIDE`. `@sanity/preview-url-secret` has to move to 4.1.5, because 5.7.3 and
6.9.1 both want `^4.1.2` and 4.0.8 would nest a second copy. `@sanity/ui` 3.5.4 nests its
own `@sanity/icons` 5 where 3.3.5 used the hoisted 3.8; harmless, leave it. And 3.5.4
still exports only `.`, `./_visual-editing`, `./theme` and `./package.json`, so plugin
bumps that want `@sanity/ui/tooltip` stay blocked until phase 2.

Related: `@sanity/ui` v3 has no subpath exports beyond `./theme`, so
`import { useToast } from '@sanity/ui/toast'` is v4-only syntax and fails
`sanity schema extract`. On v3, import from the package root.

**Therefore: Studio files never port blindly across this family.** A file copied across a
Sanity major boundary compiles and then dies at browser runtime, which is also where
schema errors surface (they pass the build). Port the _pattern_ from these cards, then
write the file against the target repo's actual major.

### Starter status: INSTALLED 2026-08-28

This repo is no longer the Sanity-5 outlier. It took the whole card in one session: the
exact pin set above, the studio folded into the root package (nested `studio/` deleted),
the Studio embedded at `/studio` via `@sanity/astro` 3.4.2, and all five preview parts
standing. Verified `find node_modules -path "*@sanity/ui/package.json"` prints exactly
one line and `grep -l "errors.md#" dist/client/_astro/*.js` exactly one file.

Three adaptations earned on the way in, each of which the NEXT repo will hit:

- **`@sanity/visual-editing` needs an `overrides` entry too, not just a dependency pin.**
  `@sanity/astro` depends on it by caret range; left alone npm nests a NEWER copy under
  `@sanity/astro/node_modules`, which drags a second `@sanity/ui` (3.5.4) in with it and
  breaks the one-instance invariant. presacademy does not show this only because its
  lockfile was resolved when 5.4.5 was the latest. Pin it in `overrides`.
- **`sanity schema extract --force` DOES exist on 6.4.0.** An earlier WCP-derived note
  said otherwise. Without `--force` the second run fails on "Schema file already exists",
  so the typegen script needs it to be re-runnable. (`--workspace` is still only needed
  with multiple workspaces.)
- **`sanity build` writes to `./dist` by default**, which would clobber the Astro build.
  There is deliberately no `studio:build` script; the Studio is built by `astro build`.
  A standalone bundle needs an explicit dir: `npx sanity build .studio-dist`.

Also worth carrying: `buildLegacyTheme` is **light-only**. It hard-codes white component
backgrounds, so the Studio's Dark appearance setting leaves every panel white. Migrating
to `@sanity/ui`'s `buildTheme` gets a real, tested dark mode and costs the brand tinting
of the Studio chrome, which is a good trade; keep the brand in the logo and the fonts.

### Genericization note for a template

A template must fail closed **legibly**. A clone with no project id and no token was
answering `/preview` with a bare 500 and a Sanity stack trace, which reads like a broken
template rather than an unfinished setup. The starter's copy checks configuration at every
preview entry point and answers **503** naming the two missing pieces plus the
`sanity cors add` step. Carry that idea, not the exact strings.

## Card 11: Preview click interceptor

**Dated 2026-08-26 (WCP). Canonical example: WCP's `PreviewLayout`.** Not installed in
the starter. presacademy has the preview stack but not this interceptor.

Inside the preview iframe, a same-origin link click escapes to the **live** page: the
Presentation navigator and edit panel stay pointed at the old document, and the Studio
appears frozen. The fix is a click interceptor in the preview layout that remaps
same-origin links into `/preview/*` so the navigator follows the click, while files, API
routes and external links open in a new tab.

Found on presacademy, fixed in WCP, still unported back. That direction of drift is
exactly what this registry exists to stop.

**Per-site adaptation: the route map is per-site.** The live-route-to-preview-route
mapping encodes that site's URL structure, so this is a pattern to re-implement, not a
file to copy. What ports is the three-way decision (remap / new tab / leave alone) and
the reason.

**Installed in the starter 2026-08-28**, including presacademy's later refinement: when
the preview is EMBEDDED in the Studio, a click on a link with no preview route is
suppressed entirely rather than opening a new tab, because inside Presentation that click
is an edit gesture and a popping tab forces a switch back to the Studio every time. A
standalone `/preview` tab still opens the new tab.

**The map lives in THREE files that must agree**, and the starter says so in each:
`SINGLETON_PREVIEW_PATHS` (`src/sanity/resolve.ts`, document to URL),
`SINGLETON_BY_PATH` (`src/pages/preview/[...slug].astro`, URL to document type), and
`FIRST_SEGMENT_PREVIEWABLE` (the interceptor). presacademy names two; the third is the
one that silently degrades, because a missed entry there does not error, it just lets a
click escape to the live site.

### Edit-mode gate (2026-08-28 amendment)

While Presentation's Edit toggle is ON, @sanity/visual-editing keeps
outline boxes (`[data-sanity-overlay-element]`) in the DOM. The
interceptor treats their presence (when embedded) as edit mode and
suppresses ALL navigation - even links with preview equivalents. A
CTA button click then selects the field and nothing else, which is
what an editor mid-edit expects. Toggle Edit off and the boxes leave
the DOM, so clicks browse the preview again (remap as before).

## Card 12: Parity-gated page-builder conversion

**Dated 2026-08-26 (presacademy). Reference:**
`presacademy/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-26-page-builder-conversion.md`.
Method, not code. The starter is page-builder-first already, so it holds the method for
the sites that are not.

Converting bespoke singleton pages into CMS-driven section types without changing a
pixel or risking content. Four decisions carried the plan:

- **D1. Ported sections do not join the shared section shell.** The existing blocks are
  tone-adaptive so editors can recolor them; art-directed page markup is not. Those two
  are mutually exclusive, and wrapping ported markup in the shared shell means subtly
  different pixels. Ported types render their own exact markup with fixed surfaces.
  Pixel-exactness wins over uniformity, at least through the conversion.
- **D2. Heroes and the final CTA stay page-level fields; only the body converts.** Every
  singleton already has hero and CTA fields editors know. Leaving them alone means no
  churn and no way for an editor to delete the page's h1. What converts is the middle.
- **D3. Fallback literals become default section arrays in code.** Each page's `??`
  fallback copy is restructured as a `DEFAULT_SECTIONS` array the renderer uses when the
  array is absent. That behavior is load-bearing: the credential-less CI build renders
  complete pages, and the axe and reflow sweeps run against them. (This starter's
  `src/data/defaultSections.ts` is the same idea, already standing.)
- **D4. Additive migration, instant rollback.** Seed scripts only ever write the sections
  array; every existing field is left untouched until a final cleanup phase. Rolling back
  a converted page is `git revert` of its commit, because the old page file returns and
  the old fields are still there. Old-field cleanup happens only after every page is
  verified live, and never through the Studio's "Remove field" button.

The gate that makes it safe is Card 3: capture before, convert, rebuild, compare, zero
diff or it is not done.

## Card 13: react/react-dom exact pin

**Dated 2026-08-25 (presacademy).** Gotcha, not a file.

`react` and `react-dom` must be the **exact** same version, in every package. Installing
Sanity into the root pulled react to 19.2.8 while react-dom stayed 19.2.6, and the build
died inside workerd behind a wall of Miniflare stack frames. The real message,
`Incompatible React versions`, was buried **above** the wrapper.

Pin both exact, no caret. General lesson: when a Miniflare or workerd failure looks
unexplainable, read the lines **above** the `MiniflareCoreError`.

**Starter status:** pinned exact 2026-08-28 with the Astro 7 upgrade: `react`,
`react-dom` and `react-is` all `19.2.7`, no caret. `react-is` was added at the same time
(the Sanity stack needs it, and it drifts the same way).

**Adjacent, learned in that session:** a stale `package-lock.json` can hide the fix. An
`overrides` entry added to collapse a nested duplicate did nothing on `npm install`
because npm kept the already-resolved nested tree; the duplicate only disappeared after
deleting the lockfile and node_modules and resolving clean. When a dedupe or override
"does not work", verify on DISK (`find node_modules -path "*<pkg>/package.json"`) rather
than trusting the install output, and be aware a clean re-resolve floats every caret.

## Card 14: wrangler legacy_env pin

**Dated 2026-08-25 (presacademy).** Gotcha, not a file.

`@astrojs/cloudflare` v14 writes `legacy_env: true` into the generated
`dist/server/wrangler.json`, and wrangler 4.126+ rejects that field outright ("no longer
supported"), so every `wrangler dev` / `deploy` against the generated config fails.
presacademy pins `wrangler` to `~4.110.0`. Revisit when a newer adapter stops emitting
the field.

**Starter status (2026-08-28): pinned `~4.110.0`, with a finding.** The generated
`dist/server/wrangler.json` from adapter **14.2.4** on this config contains **no**
`legacy_env` field at all, and `wrangler dev` against it serves every route. So on this
combination the pin is currently belt-and-braces rather than load-bearing. The reason it
stays is a second, harder constraint: **the adapter's own peer range enforces the pair.**
14.2.4 peers `wrangler ^4.83.0`, but 14.2.5 peers `wrangler ^4.125.0`, which is one minor
away from the 4.126 rejection. So the starter pins the ADAPTER exact at 14.2.4 as well.
Moving either one is a deliberate act: bump both, rebuild, inspect the generated config
for `legacy_env`, and run a real `wrangler dev` before believing it.

Adjacent, same family of pain: WCP's deploy must be
`wrangler deploy -c dist/server/wrangler.json`; a plain `wrangler deploy` 404s every
sub-route. And this starter pins `@astrojs/cloudflare` to exactly 13.5.5 because 13.6.0
regressed the image optimizer (optimized images written to `dist/client/_astro/` while
the optimizer reads `dist/_astro/`). Three separate adapter-version landmines; the shared
rule is that adapter and wrangler versions are a matched pair, verified by a real build.

## Card 15: PENDING.md / TESTING.md docs registry

**Dated 2026-08-27. Origin: WCP (`site/docs/`).**

Two flat markdown registries, kept authoritative rather than narrative:

- **PENDING.md** - the open-patch and waiting-on-a-human queue. Every deferred change
  with its blocker, so a new session can read the queue instead of rediscovering it. WCP
  proved the value during the 2026-07 Sanity quota freeze: the entire queue survived the
  freeze in the file and ran to completion in one sitting when quota returned.
- **TESTING.md** - a map of which suite covers what, so nobody writes a fifth suite that
  duplicates the third.

The practice, not the filenames, is what ports: a registry is authoritative and gets
edited in the same commit as the thing it tracks; a changelog is narrative and appends.
Keeping both, and knowing which is which, is the whole trick.

**In this starter:** `PORTS.md` (this file) is the machine-checkable registry of what is
shared with the rest of the family, backed by `scripts/sync-check.mjs`.
`docs/agent/changelog.md` stays the prose ledger. `docs/PENDING.md` was added 2026-08-28
for the third thing neither of those covers: this repo's own open loops and
waiting-on-a-human items. Something that needs to be _checked_ belongs here; something
that needs to be _understood in sequence_ belongs in the changelog; something that is
_still open_ belongs in PENDING.

There is no TESTING.md yet: the suite is one `npm test` over `src/lib/*.test.ts` plus the
parity harness, and a map of two things is not worth a file. Write one the day a second
suite (Playwright, card 8) lands.

## Card 16: Quarterly slop sweep (2026-08-28)

**What:** a scheduled REDUCTION pass per site, because the per-commit gates
catch regressions but nothing schedules cleanup: an app keeps working while
its code and docs quietly degrade, then one simple feature request breaks
everything (the failure mode that bit presacademy's README/CLAUDE.md drift in
June 2026).

**The sweep, roughly one session per site:**

1. Run the /simplify and code-review passes over recent hot spots.
2. Dead-weight grep: unused deps (`npm ls` orphans, imports nothing
   references), dead components, stale scripts without RAN/DO-NOT-RUN headers.
3. Doc-drift check: CLAUDE.md commands/routes vs reality, PENDING.md pruning,
   guide steps vs the actual Studio.
4. Re-run sync-check and the site's full gates; log findings as gotchas or
   PORTS cards when they generalize.

**Cadence:** quarterly per actively-maintained site; on-demand before any big
planned change on a dormant one. Tick the matrix cell with the sweep DATE
rather than "yes" so staleness is visible.

**Provenance:** distilled from community experience (the "AI slop is very
real / the app keeps working while the code gets worse" lesson) and our own
June drift incident.

## Card 17: In-canvas section controls (2026-08-28)

**What:** Squarespace-style editing inside the Presentation preview: each
rendered section carries a `data-sanity` attribute (createDataAttribute ->
`flexibleSections[_key=="..."]` on a REAL block box, never display:contents),
which makes the visual-editing overlay outline it as an array item with
insert-before/after (the grouped insert menu opens IN the canvas), duplicate,
remove, and drag-to-reorder (on by default once the attribute exists; the
mutation writes itself). Pair with `insertMenu.filter: true`. Attribute
renders on preview surfaces only; the live build must stay byte-identical
(parity enforces it).

**DEPENDS ON card 10** (the full live-preview stack). Sites without it get
card 10 first. Canonical implementation: presacademy; WCP has the attribute
half already (sectionEditAttr).

**Installed in the starter 2026-08-28.** Two adaptation notes:

- **The array field name is per-repo, and here it is ONE name.** presacademy's
  singletons use `flexibleSections` while its custom pages use `sections`, so its
  `EditDoc` carries a discriminating `field`. This template holds every page's
  sections in `pageBuilder`, singletons and `page` docs alike, so the field is a
  single-member union kept only so the shape ports back.
- **The preview-only wrapper does not need a component.** `SectionRenderer` picks
  `const Wrap = editDoc ? 'div' : Fragment` and spreads the attribute. A
  `<Fragment>` renders nothing, so the live build is byte-identical without a
  second code path to keep honest. `npm run parity compare` passed 10/10 with the
  feature installed, which is the proof.
- **The grouped insert menu had to be created**, not merely switched on: this
  template had no `insertMenu` config at all. `SECTION_INSERT_MENU` in
  `src/sanity/schemaTypes/sections.ts` (four plain-language groups plus
  `filter: true`) is shared by every `pageBuilder` array, including the curated
  per-page lists, because a group whose types are all absent from a given array
  simply does not render.

**Rollout intent (Nathan, 2026-08-28): every Sanity site gets this.** Order:
presacademy (canonical) -> WCP polish delta -> THE STARTER (upgrade the
template once: Astro 7 / adapter 14 / Sanity 6.4 pin set / embedded
single-package studio / preview stack / these controls - so future sites are
born with it) -> church-starter inherits by sync -> reid (already Sanity 6,
shortest hop, most active) -> mas -> 2ndpreschicago (after its DNS cutover).
Follow-up polish on the same card: the insert menu's grid view with
per-section-type preview thumbnails, and "duplicate page" in the navigator.

### Card 10/17 lore corrections (mas upgrade, 2026-08-28)

- **The one-styled-components invariant grep must be precise.**
  `grep -l "errors.md#" dist/client/_astro/*.js` false-positives on any
  bundle containing `polished` (a Sanity dependency using the same
  filename). Use `styled-components/src/utils/errors.md#` as the
  pattern. (The starter and church builds happened not to co-locate
  polished, which is why 'one file' held there.)
- **Stega markers are zero-width characters, not the Unicode tag
  block** - measuring the tag block reads zero on a fully encoded
  string and mimics a broken preview.
- **`wrangler ~4.110` is LOAD-BEARING on some configs**: mas's adapter
  14.2.4 build DOES emit legacy_env, unlike the starter's. The pin
  stays a hard rule, not belt-and-braces.
- **Keyless primitive arrays** (arrays of plain strings) have no `_key`;
  in-canvas attributes must fall back to index paths or controls
  silently do not render.
- **The founding `overrides: {vite:"^7"}`** in older forks starves
  Astro 7 of vite 8 and surfaces as "Could not find the prerender
  entry point". Remove it in phase A.
- **Auto-deploy-from-main repos**: the dashboard deploy command must
  switch to `-c dist/server/wrangler.json` BEFORE the upgrade merges,
  or /studio and /preview 404. Land on a holding branch until the
  human flips it (mas: staging branch).

## Card 18: Chrome options (editable header/footer content)

**What:** the header and footer stop being code. One shared `navLink` object
type gives every menu the same vocabulary, and Site Settings grows the fields
that let an editor change the top menu, the footer link columns, the small-print
row at the very bottom, the one header button, the logo, and three "show this
bit of contact detail" switches - without a deploy. This is Phase A of the
Unlocked Studio: the chrome is the last thing on a page that still needed a
developer.

**The navLink vocabulary.** `src/sanity/schemaTypes/navLink.ts`, registered as a
top-level type and used by EVERY menu (top menu, dropdown children, footer
columns, legal row, the header button's destination):

- `label` - what visitors see.
- `linkType` - radio: "A page on this site" / "Another website".
- `internalPage` - a reference to a page document. The address is worked out
  from the DEREFERENCED document type + slug, so renaming a slug can never
  leave a dead menu link.
- `externalUrl` - a full web address.
- `href` - the original hand-typed address (see the compat rule below).

Every document type listed in `internalPage.to[]` must have an entry in
`SINGLETON_LIVE_PATHS` in `src/lib/nav-href.ts` (or the slug-based `page` case),
or the link resolves to nothing. That map mirrors `SINGLETON_PREVIEW_PATHS` in
`src/sanity/resolve.ts` with the `/preview` prefix removed; keep them in sync
when a route moves.

**The legacy-href-wins compat rule.** Every repo already had menus stored as
`{label, href}` objects, most of them typed `navLink`. Nothing is renamed and
nothing is migrated. `href` is kept on the shared type and it WINS over both
newer fields, so today's menus render byte-identically; it hides itself once a
link uses the picker. Where an inline object had a different name (the footer's
`footerLink`), that member stays in the array alongside the shared type, titled
"Link (typed address)", so columns written before the picker stay editable in
place. Precedence inside one link, decided in exactly one function
(`navHref()`): typed `href`, then the picked page, then the pasted URL. A link
that resolves to nothing is DROPPED, never rendered as a dead `<a>`.

**The centralized-fallback rule.** No component may re-implement a menu
fallback. `resolveSiteSettings()` in `src/lib/siteSettings.ts` is the one place
that decides what each chrome field resolves to, and Header / MobileNav / Footer
read `settings.headerNav`, `.footerColumns`, `.legalNav`, `.headerCta`, `.logo`,
`.showEmail`, `.showSocials`, `.showFooterSocials` and render. Two shapes of
fallback, and which one a menu gets is decided by its built-in version:

- A menu whose built-in version is DATA (the top menu, the header button)
  resolves to that built-in when Sanity is empty, so the caller renders one loop
  with no branch.
- A menu whose built-in version is BESPOKE MARKUP (the starter's
  Studio/Work/Free-tools columns, each link carrying its own module-visibility
  flag; a legal row whose two links carry different link styles) resolves to an
  EMPTY array, and the component keeps its own markup for that case. Flattening
  those into data would change the rendered bytes of an untouched site, and
  parity is the gate.

The three switches use `onUnlessOff()`: `undefined` means YES. Sanity's
`initialValue` only fills NEW documents, so a live singleton has no value for a
newly added boolean at all - if undefined meant "off", the header would silently
lose its email and socials the moment the field shipped.

**Two more halves that are easy to forget.** The GROQ projection has to
dereference the picked page (`"slug": internalPage->slug.current`,
`"docType": internalPage->_type`), and `SITE_SETTINGS_PROJECTION` must be
EXPORTED so `PreviewLayout.astro` fetches the chrome through it too. A preview
shell that fetches the raw document leaves every picked-page link null, which
looks like "the picker is broken" and is not.

**Parity gotcha found installing this (starter + church, 2026-08-28):**
importing `SanityImage.astro` into `Header.astro` for the logo pulls that
component into the always-loaded chunk and RENAMES the site-wide CSS bundle
(`BaseLayout.HASH.css` -> `SanityImage.HASH.css`), which fails parity on every
page without one byte of markup changing. Build the logo URL with `urlFor()` and
emit a plain `<img>` with a two-density srcset instead. A header renders on
every page; what it imports is a site-wide decision.

**Applied to:** presacademy yes (canonical) / wcp yes (its own navigation-doc
flavor) / starter yes / church-starter yes / reid staged / mas staged /
2ndpres parked (after its DNS cutover).

## Card 19: Shareable draft links (2026-08-28)

**Canonical:** `src/sanity/components/shareDraftLink.tsx`

**What:** a "Copy share link" affordance in the Studio that hands an editor a URL
an outside reviewer can open, with no Sanity login, to read the CURRENT DRAFT of
one page. It sits in the publish menu of every document that has a page of its
own (a document action registered in `sanity.config.ts`), and, in repos that ship
the Presentation page navigator, as a per-row icon button on that list too.

**Why:** "can the board chair read this before it goes live?" had two answers and
both were wrong. Publish it and unpublish it, or make a volunteer a Sanity
account. The mechanism to do it properly was already in the repo and had only
ever been pointed at an iframe.

**How the link is minted.** `createPreviewSecret()` from
`@sanity/preview-url-secret/create-secret` - the same call the Presentation tool
makes, from the Studio's own authenticated client. The returned secret is dropped
into the URL the enable endpoint already understands:

```
/api/draft-mode/enable?sanity-preview-secret=<minted>&sanity-preview-pathname=/preview/<page>
```

`/api/draft-mode/enable` is NOT modified by this card. It still runs
`validatePreviewUrl()` and still answers a bare 401 for an invalid, tampered, or
expired secret before setting any cookie. The feature is additive: a new way to
obtain a valid secret, not a new way in.

**The TTL caveat, stated in the UI.** `SECRET_TTL` is a hard-coded `60 * 60` in
`@sanity/preview-url-secret/constants`, and the validating query (`_updatedAt >
now() - SECRET_TTL`) lives inside the package. There is no `ttl` option on the
create call and no supported way to widen it, so **a share link works for about
an hour and then stops**. Every surface says so out loud - the toast, the button
tooltip, the document-action title, the church guide - because the alternative is
a reviewer meeting a 401 the next morning and reporting the site as broken.
Re-minting is one click, which is the intended answer to an expired link.

The package also ships a "shared access" singleton with a NON-expiring secret
(`toggle-preview-access-sharing`). Deliberately not used: it switches draft
preview on for anyone who ever saw any link, forever, with no per-link
revocation. For a volunteer-run site a one-hour link is the safer default.

**HTTPS only.** The enable endpoint sets its cookie `secure: true; sameSite:
none` (required because Presentation loads it cross-context). Browsers refuse a
secure cookie over plain http, so share links work on the deployed origin and not
against `http://localhost:4321`. Test them deployed.

**Per-site adaptation:** none beyond having the preview stack (card 10). The
module derives the preview path from that repo's own `pathForDoc()` in
`src/sanity/urls.ts`, so a repo with different routes needs no edit here. Repos
without a `PreviewNavigator.tsx` get the document action only, which is a
complete feature on its own.

**Applied to:** starter yes (canonical) / church-starter yes (document action
only, it has no page navigator) / everything else pending rollout.

## Card 20: publishAt scheduled publishing, free tier (2026-08-28)

**Canonical:** `src/sanity/schemaTypes/_publishAt.ts`, `scripts/publish-due.mjs`,
`.github/workflows/publish-due.yml`

**What:** an editor sets "Publish automatically at" on a page, leaves it as a
draft, and it publishes itself. Three small parts: a `datetime` field, a
dependency-free Node script, and a half-hourly workflow.

**Why:** Sanity's own Scheduled Drafts is a **Growth-plan** feature. Every site in
this family runs on the free plan, and "write it Friday night, have it live
Monday morning" is a thing volunteers actually ask for, so it gets built rather
than bought.

**The field.** `PUBLISH_AT_GROUP` + `publishAtField()` are exported as a PAIR and
must be spread together - the group into the type's `groups`, the field into its
`fields`. A field naming a group its type never declared is a hard Studio 6.4+
crash, not a warning. The script's query is schema-agnostic, so adding the pair
to a new document type is the entire installation: no script change, no workflow
change.

**Timezone honesty.** Sanity's datetime input shows and accepts the editor's
LOCAL time and stores UTC; the script compares against `now()` evaluated by
Sanity, so it is UTC on both sides and the runner's own clock is irrelevant. The
description says "your own local time" so nobody has to reason about it, and
"within the half hour" so nobody expects 9:00:00.

**Publishing is two mutations in one request.** Sanity's own publish action is
`createOrReplace` at the id without the `drafts.` prefix, then `delete` the draft.
This mirrors that, in a single mutation array so it is atomic. `publishAt` is
STRIPPED on the way through rather than cleared afterwards: the published
document never carries a schedule, so there is no window in which a crash between
two writes leaves a document that republishes itself every half hour.

**The no-npm-install cron design, and why.** At `*/30` this runs 48 times a day.
`npm ci` would spend a couple of minutes of Actions time per run installing
several hundred megabytes in order to make three HTTP calls - roughly two hours
of runner time a day to publish, on most days, nothing. So `publish-due.mjs`
imports nothing from `node_modules`: it uses global `fetch` against Sanity's HTTP
API and the job is checkout + setup-node + node, a few seconds. Its only local
import is `scripts/lib/loadEnv.mjs`, itself dependency-free and used only for
local runs. **If the script ever needs a package, the design broke; do not add an
install step.**

Endpoints, both `Authorization: Bearer <SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN>`:

- `POST https://<projectId>.api.sanity.io/v2025-02-19/data/query/<dataset>?perspective=raw`
  with `{query}`. `perspective=raw` is required - the default perspective hides
  `drafts.*`, which are the only documents this cares about.
- `POST https://<projectId>.api.sanity.io/v2025-02-19/data/mutate/<dataset>?returnIds=true`
  with `{mutations:[{createOrReplace}, {delete}]}`.

**Dry run by default.** Bare `node scripts/publish-due.mjs` prints the queue and
writes nothing; `--apply` publishes. The workflow passes `--apply`. Same gate as
every other Sanity script in `scripts/`, for the same reason: a human running it
by hand cannot publish by accident.

**Workflow gating** is card 6's two-job gate, copied verbatim: a `gate` job checks
for the `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN` secret and the `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` variable and emits
a `::warning::` with `ready=false` when either is missing, and the `publish` job
is `if: needs.gate.outputs.ready == 'true'`. A fork without the secret skips
instead of failing. One difference from the backup workflow: this token must have
WRITE access, where a read token is enough for the backup.

**In both TEMPLATE repos the `schedule:` block ships COMMENTED OUT**, exactly as
`sanity-backup.yml` does, because neither template has a Sanity project of its
own and a gate job firing 48 times a day only to skip is the same waste in
miniature. A fork uncomments one line. `workflow_dispatch` stays on, so a manual
run always works.

**Per-site adaptation:** set the secret and the variable, uncomment the schedule,
and add the field pair to any document type that should be schedulable.

**Applied to:** starter yes (canonical, on `page` + the `_pageSingleton` factory)
/ church-starter yes (on `page` + the `churchPages` factory, so all eleven church
page singletons) / everything else pending rollout.

## Card 21: Pages as first-class objects (2026-08-28)

**Canonical:** `src/sanity/pageOps.ts`, `src/sanity/components/pageActions.tsx`,
`src/sanity/schemaTypes/_seoFields.ts`, `src/sanity/components/SeoSnippetInput.tsx`

**What:** three verbs and one panel that turn a `page` document from a row in a
list into something an editor can handle like a page in Squarespace.

- **Duplicate.** Copies the page into a NEW DRAFT called "... copy", at a free
  web address ("about" then "about-copy" then "about-copy-2"), with every nested
  array `_key` regenerated.
- **Archive / Restore.** Sets `archived` on both twins. Every live-site query
  skips an archived page; nothing is deleted, so Restore is complete.
- **Search & sharing.** The SEO group gains a live Google-snippet and share-card
  preview at the top, and a "Keep this page out of Google" switch.

**Why Duplicate had to be rebuilt.** Sanity ships a `duplicate` action, and it
copies the slug. The copy is then a second document claiming an address that is
already taken; the build can emit only one of them and which one wins is
arbitrary. The config filters the stock action out for `page` and registers ours
in its place, so the menu still reads "Duplicate" and now does the right thing.

**Why Archive is not Delete.** Delete is refused while any other document links
to the page, and it throws the words away. An event page an editor wants back
next year is the common case, not the rare one. `archived` is a plain boolean;
the live-site queries test `archived != true`, **never `archived == false`**, so
a page created before the field existed stays visible. Delete is still there for
a page that really should go.

**Both twins, and only the twins that exist.** `setPageArchived()` looks up which
of `<id>` / `drafts.<id>` are actually present before patching. A patch against a
missing document id fails the WHOLE transaction, so patching both blind throws on
a page that has no draft, which is most of them.

**Archive needs a publish** to reach the live site, because the site is rebuilt
from published content. Every toast says so.

**One implementation, two surfaces.** The verbs are plain functions in
`pageOps.ts`. `pageActions.tsx` puts them in the publish menu (every repo);
`PreviewNavigator.tsx` puts them on a per-row "..." menu with an **Archived**
group at the bottom of the list (only the repos that ship the page navigator).
A repo with no navigator has the complete feature from the document actions
alone, which is how the church starter has it.

**REUSE, DO NOT RENAME (the SEO panel's one rule).** `seoFields()` takes the
document's EXISTING SEO field definitions in a `reuse` argument and puts them in
the right order, rather than defining new ones. A rename would move the data to a
new path, and every page in the dataset would quietly go back to a default title.
So on a type that already had SEO fields the helper contributes exactly two new
things: the value-less `seoPreview` field whose custom input draws the previews,
and `hideFromSearch`.

**`hideFromSearch` has to be honoured in TWO places or it is a dead control:** a
`<meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow">` on the page (the route passes
`noindex` to `BaseLayout`), and the page dropped from the sitemap (the `filter`
in `astro.config.mjs`, fed by a build-time query). One without the other is worse
than neither, because the switch looks like it worked.

**The preview is an INPUT, never a document VIEW.** It calls `useFormValue`,
which needs a `FormValueProvider`. An input always renders inside the document
form, so the provider is there. A standalone `S.view.component` pane does NOT get
one inside the Presentation tool: the hook throws, the panel's error boundary
trips, and the preview iframe stops refreshing. This cost the WCP repo an evening
in 2026-07; keep the split.

**Per-site adaptation:** `PAGE_OPS_TYPES` in `pageActions.tsx` is `{'page'}` -
the multi-instance builder page every repo in this family has. Page SINGLETONS
are deliberately excluded: one-per-site means duplicating or archiving one would
leave the site with a route and no document. `pageOps.ts` reads and writes the
slug in whichever shape the repo uses (Sanity's `slug` object, or WCP's plain
string, which has to hold slashes), so no edit is needed there either. The only
real per-site work is passing the repo's own SEO field definitions into
`seoFields({ reuse })`, and wiring `noindex` on the routes that render `page`.

**Applied to:** starter yes (canonical: publish-menu actions + navigator rows) /
church-starter yes (publish-menu actions only, it has no page navigator) / WCP
partial (the same feature, older and repo-specific: its navigator carries the
verbs and its `seoFields.ts` predates this canonical copy) / everything else
pending rollout.

## Card 22: Redirects on rename (2026-08-28)

**Canonical:** `src/lib/redirects.ts` (+ `src/lib/redirects.test.ts`),
`src/sanity/components/slugRedirect.tsx`

**What:** an editor changes a page's web address, presses Publish, and the old
address keeps working. A `redirect` document type holds the forwards, a
build-time read folds them into Astro's `redirects` map, and a wrapper around the
stock Publish action files one automatically on a rename.

**Why:** the manual Redirects list on its own depends on somebody remembering at
exactly the wrong moment. Every bookmark, printed bulletin, and Google result for
the old address 404s quietly until they do.

**Build time, not request time.** These are `output: 'static'` sites, so the 404
route is prerendered and middleware never runs for it. Making it SSR to read a
redirect list would put a Worker invocation in front of the one route that exists
to be cheap. The Cloudflare adapter turns the `redirects` map into real 301s at
build, which cost nothing per request, and a publish rebuilds the site anyway.

**The path arithmetic is shared and tested.** `src/lib/redirects.ts` is imported
by BOTH `astro.config.mjs` (build) and the Studio action. If the two disagreed
about what `/old-page/` means, an auto-filed redirect would sit in the Studio
looking correct and never fire. Hence `redirects.test.ts`. The rules: normalize
both sides, drop a self-redirect, drop a half-filled row, drop an external
left-hand side (it could never match a request), later entry wins.

**No type list in the action, on purpose.** Which documents have a slug-derived
address is already encoded in each repo's `pathForDoc()` (`src/sanity/urls.ts`).
A type with a fixed path returns the same string before and after, so the
comparison is a no-op for it; a type with no public page returns null. That is
what lets `slugRedirect.tsx` be byte-identical across repos with completely
different routes, and why `redirects.ts` deliberately does NOT carry a
document-type-to-path map the way WCP's ancestor version does.

**The wrapper must be memoized.** A document-action wrapper needs a STABLE
component identity across renders, or React unmounts and remounts the action
every pass and the stock Publish action loses its own state (the "publishing..."
spinner, the disabled logic). The actions resolver in `sanity.config.ts` runs on
every render, so the wrapper is cached in a `WeakMap` keyed by the action it
wraps.

**It never blocks Publish.** A failed redirect write toasts a warning and
publishes anyway. The editor's change is the important part; the forward can be
added by hand.

**Renames repoint, they do not chain.** A second rename patches the existing
`A -> B` entry to `A -> C` rather than adding `B -> C`, so visitors always take
one hop. An existing redirect for the same old address is never overwritten: it
may have been hand-corrected.

**The redirect is created PUBLISHED** (a plain `create`, not a draft), because
the build-time reader only sees published documents. A draft redirect would look
filed and never fire.

**Fail-safe reads.** `cmsQuery()` in `astro.config.mjs` returns the empty answer
for anything that is not a clean 200 - no project id, no token, Sanity down, bad
data - so this feature can never fail a build.

**Per-site adaptation:** a site that also carries hand-written launch redirects
(WCP's Squarespace map) puts them BEFORE `...cmsRedirects` in the `redirects`
object, so a Studio entry can correct a stale launch one without a code change.

**Applied to:** starter yes (canonical) / church-starter yes / WCP yes (the
original, with a repo-specific `redirects.ts` that also owns the doc-type path
map, plus the launch-migration entries) / everything else pending rollout.

## Card 23: Editor-defined forms (2026-08-28)

**Canonical:** `src/lib/custom-form-fields.ts` (+ `src/lib/custom-form-fields.test.ts`),
`src/sanity/schemaTypes/formQuestion.ts`

**What:** an editor writes their own form questions in the Studio and the site
asks them. A `formQuestion` object holds one question (the words, an answer type,
choices for a dropdown, and whether it must be answered); a `fields` array on the
form surface holds up to twelve of them. Empty array, and the form is exactly the
form that shipped. One question, and the visitor sees the editor's form.

**Why:** "can you add a question to the form?" is the single most common request a
volunteer or a small-business owner makes, and until now it was a developer
ticket every time. The whole point of the page-builder is that it is not.

**The standard contact block ALWAYS leads.** Name, email, and phone are drawn
first, before any editor question, on every path. This is the load-bearing rule
of the whole card, and it exists because the failure it prevents is silent: an
editor builds a perfectly reasonable form, forgets to ask for an email address,
and the site collects messages nobody can ever reply to. Nothing an editor can
write removes that block. A schema that lets an editor define ALL the fields (as
church-starter's older `form` document does) has this hole; this one does not.

**The answers are folded into the message, and that is the entire design.** The
renderer names each answer `custom_<n>` and carries the question text alongside
it in `custom_<n>_label` (plus a `custom_<n>_req` marker). The submit path turns
those into plain `Question: answer` lines and appends them to the `message` the
site already sends. So a brand-new question needs NO code change, NO schema
change, and no change to whatever receives the submission - Web3Forms, an email,
a webhook, a Sanity `submission` document, a Google Sheet. Downstream never
learns that editor-defined questions exist. Resist the temptation to give each
question its own key in the payload: that is the version that needs a migration
every time somebody renames a question.

**Two pure functions, shared by both sides, unit-tested.**
`normalizeCustomFields()` shapes the raw Sanity value into what the renderer
draws; `parseCustomFieldEntries()` turns posted `[name, value]` pairs into the
lines. They are in one dependency-free module because the renderer and the submit
path MUST agree about the caps and about what "answered" means. `parse` takes an
`Iterable<[string, string]>`, which is exactly what `FormData.entries()` gives a
server route and what a React island can synthesize, so the same tested code
serves a native POST and a client-side fetch.

**The caps are deliberate and belong to the library, not the schema:** 12
questions, 2000 characters per answer, 12000 characters over all answers, 200
characters per question label. The Studio validates the 12 as well, but the
Studio is not a security boundary - a stale open page can post anything. Twelve
is also a design limit, not just a safety one: a longer form is the fastest way
to lose the person filling it in.

**It degrades instead of throwing.** A question with no label cannot be asked and
a dropdown with no choices cannot be answered, so both are dropped; an unknown
answer type falls back to a text box; questions past the cap are IGNORED rather
than rejected, so a page a visitor left open before an edit still submits.

**Never log an answer.** The parser returns a visitor-facing error string and
nothing else. Form answers are the most personal data these sites handle.

**Native validation plus `aria-required` plus a visible cue.** All three, on every
required question, so the browser, assistive technology, and the eye agree. The
honeypot on the existing form is preserved untouched.

**Type name: `formQuestion`, not `formField`.** church-starter's `form` document
already registers a `formField` array member, and two schema types with one name
is a Studio-runtime crash that a build will not catch. The canonical file is
byte-identical everywhere, so it cannot dodge the collision per-repo - the name
had to be chosen to clear it once. WCP's ancestor version calls it `formField`;
that is the one intentional divergence from the original.

**Per-site adaptation:** wire the `fields` array into whatever the repo's form
story already is, and fold the lines into whatever it already submits. WCP has an
Astro API route and a native POST, so it appends the lines to the stored/emailed
`message` server-side. Both templates are React islands posting to Web3Forms, so
the fold happens in the island just before `fetch`, and the payload still carries
one `message`. In the starter the questions REPLACE the built-in project
questionnaire (a form asking both "rough budget range" and a church picnic
question is nonsense); in church-starter they are an alternative to referencing a
`form` document. In both, an empty array is a zero-diff no-op, which is what makes
the change safe to ship: `page-parity compare` proves it.

**Applied to:** starter yes (canonical, on `contactPage.formFields`) /
church-starter yes (on the `sectionForm` page-builder block) / WCP yes (the
original, `formField` + an `/api/contact` server fold) / everything else pending
rollout.

## Card 24: Saved sections (2026-08-28)

**Canonical:** `src/sanity/actions/saveSectionPreset.tsx`, plus `addSectionToPage()`
in `src/sanity/pageOps.ts`
**Per repo:** `src/sanity/schemaTypes/sectionPreset.ts`,
`src/sanity/pageBuilderConfig.ts`

**What:** an editor keeps one band of a page and drops a copy of it on any other
page. "Save a section as preset..." in a page's publish menu lists that page's
sections, the editor picks one and names it, and a `sectionPreset` document is
written. Adding it back is a copy, not a link.

**Why:** the section an editor is proudest of is the one they most want to
repeat, and today repeating it means either rebuilding it by hand or duplicating
a whole page to get at one strip of it. The page-builder promises reuse and
until now offered none.

**THE SCHEMA SHAPE IS THE WHOLE TRICK.** `section` is an ARRAY of every section
type, capped at one by validation. Sanity has no syntax for a union OBJECT
field, and a field per type would be twenty fields. The array buys three things
for free: the same grouped insert menu the page builder uses, the real section
FORM (so a saved section is EDITABLE in place, not just replayed), and the
type's own preview. `sectionType` is a read-only stamp copied out of the array
when the preset is captured, so a list can label a preset without opening it.

**No field groups on the type, deliberately.** An undefined group name is a
fatal Studio-RUNTIME error in Sanity 6.4 that `astro build` does not catch. Four
fields need no tabs, so the risk is simply not taken.

**Why a document action and not the section's own menu.** Array-item menus are
built from the array input's options and the visual-editing overlay's toolbar is
internal; Sanity opens neither to a plugin. A document action is the surface we
own.

**It writes a PUBLISHED preset and reads the DRAFT page.** A preset is a tool,
not content: nothing about it reaches the website, so "publish your saved
section before you can use it" would be ceremony. The source is the draft
because a section is usually saved right after it is made.

**Adding one always writes to the DRAFT of the target page**, and the section
lands at the BOTTOM. A saved section that went live on click would be a publish
nobody asked for. When the target has no draft yet, one is made from the
published document first, which is exactly what typing in the form would have
done. Every `_key` is regenerated at every depth on the way in AND on the way
out, so the same preset can go on the same page twice.

**THE INSERT SURFACE DIFFERS PER REPO, AND THAT IS THE INTERESTING PART.** The
verb is one function (`addSectionToPage` in the canonical `pageOps.ts`); only
the direction of the question changes:

- **Repos with the Presentation navigator** (starter, wcp) get a collapsible
  "Saved sections" group under the page list, one "add" button per row, adding
  to the page the preview is currently showing. Current page = the sticky
  pending navigation intent ?? `params.preview`, matched against row hrefs (exact
  first, `endsWith` fallback) - the same resolution the row highlight uses, so a
  click and an immediate "Add" can never disagree. Disabled with a plain-words
  tooltip when no page is open, or when the open page has no builder array.
- **Repos with no navigator** (church-starter) get "Add to a page..." on the
  saved section ITSELF, listing the pages grouped Main / Custom. Same verb,
  reversed direction. Archived pages are left out: adding to a page that is off
  the site is almost certainly a misclick.

A page's own "+ Add section" picker can offer schema TYPES only, never
documents, which is why neither surface is inside it.

**Applied to:** starter yes (canonical + navigator group) / church-starter yes
(canonical + "Add to a page..." action) / WCP partial (the original: its own
`sectionPreset`, its own `saveSectionPreset.tsx` and navigator group, all
pre-config-object - see the fold-back note on card 25) / everything else pending
rollout.

## Card 25: Pre-publish page checks (2026-08-28)

**Canonical:** `src/lib/page-checks.ts` (+ `src/lib/page-checks.test.ts`),
`src/sanity/actions/checkPage.tsx`
**Per repo:** `src/sanity/pageBuilderConfig.ts`

**What:** "Check this page..." in a page's publish menu reads the DRAFT back and
reports three kinds of "worth a look": photos with no alt text, sections with
nothing typed in them, and links to same-site addresses no page seems to own.

**Why:** an editor about to publish has no way to ask "did I forget anything?"
short of reading the whole page again, and the three things they forget are
always the same three.

**IT NEVER BLOCKS PUBLISH AND IT NEVER EDITS.** Sanity's own required-field
validation already stops genuinely broken content; this is the softer layer
above it. Every line of copy says "worth a look" rather than "wrong", the dialog
ends with a line admitting it can be mistaken, and the Publish button is
untouched while it is open. The moment a courtesy check starts refusing things,
editors learn to click past it.

**Every check is a heuristic that UNDER-REPORTS on purpose.** The link check
compares by FIRST PATH SEGMENT only, because `/events/harvest-supper` and
`/journal/spring-refresh` are real addresses built by code from a collection and
no `page` document owns them; matching whole paths would flag half the site and
the feature would be ignored inside a week. Alt text is accepted in any of the
three shapes the family models it in (`alt` on the image, `alt` beside it,
`<key>Alt` beside it), so a parent holding two images and one alt reads as
described. That miss is the right trade.

**"Empty" needs two exemption lists or it is permanently silent.** Setting keys
(`variant`, `tone`, `layout`, `background`, ...) are enum values with an
initialValue, so a completely untouched section already has several strings in
it; they do not count as words. And sections that fill THEMSELVES from a
collection (an FAQ list, an auto list, a form) are skipped whole: a dynamic list
with no heading is not an empty section, it is a section whose words live in the
Events list.

**THE CONFIG OBJECT IS THE PORT.** WCP's ancestor hard-codes its own array field
name (`sections`), its own `SETTING_KEYS`, its own `SELF_FILLING_SECTIONS`, and
its own `CODE_OWNED_PATHS` in the library file, which makes that file
unshareable: the three repos name their builder arrays `pageBuilder`,
`sections`, and `flexibleSections`, and no two agree on which sections are
self-filling. The canonical core now takes a `PageCheckConfig` and every
repo-specific answer arrives from `src/sanity/pageBuilderConfig.ts`, at a path
every repo shares. That file also carries `SECTION_HOST_TYPES` (type -> builder
field), which is what wires card 24's actions and the document-actions resolver,
so a fork adapts BOTH cards by editing one file.

**Two shape changes came with the config, and both are deliberate:**

1. **Section numbering runs on across several arrays.** A repo with a main
   builder and an "extra sections" append zone shows the editor one list, so the
   checks count one list.
2. **The header (hero) is NOT checked for emptiness by default.** WCP's version
   checks it. Here `header.checkEmpty` is opt-in, because in two of the three
   repos a page whose banner is one background photo over built-in copy is a
   perfectly normal page, and flagging it would be the false positive that
   teaches an editor to ignore the dialog. WCP sets it true when it folds back.

**FUTURE WCP SYNC TASK (done 2026-08-28).** WCP still runs the pre-config ancestor of
`page-checks.ts`, `checkPage.tsx`, `saveSectionPreset.tsx` and its own
`sanity-keys.ts`. Folding it forward is: add `src/sanity/pageBuilderConfig.ts`
with `sectionArrays: ['sections']`, `header: { label: 'Hero (top banner)',
fields: ['hero'], checkEmpty: true }`, its `SELF_FILLING_SECTIONS` and
`CODE_OWNED_PATHS` lists, and `SECTION_HOST_TYPES` for `page` (+ `hubPage` if
the hub ever gains the action); drop in the four canonical files; move
`newKey`/`regenerateKeys` from `src/lib/sanity-keys.ts` to `pageOps.ts` (which
WCP does not yet carry) or keep `sanity-keys.ts` and re-point the canonical
imports - the second is drift, so prefer the first; port the Vitest suite to the
node:test canonical copy; and add the PORTABLE markers. Nothing about it is
urgent: the ancestor works, it is simply not shared.

**Applied to:** starter yes (canonical) / church-starter yes (canonical) / WCP
partial (the pre-config ancestor, see the fold-back note above) / everything
else pending rollout.

## Card 26: Appearance controls (2026-08-28)

**Canonical:** `src/lib/inline-rich.ts`, `src/lib/heading-accent.ts`,
`src/components/InlineRich.astro`
**Per repo (NOT canonical, on purpose):** `src/lib/surfaces.ts` +
`src/lib/surfaces.test.ts`, `src/lib/layout-variants.ts` +
`src/lib/layout-variants.test.ts`, `src/sanity/components/SwatchInput.tsx`,
the `.heading-accent` / `.accent-*` / `.surface-*` rules in
`src/styles/globals.css`

**What:** the four things an editor kept asking for and could not have. A
section's SURFACE, picked from a row of designed colour chips. Its ACCENT, the
small colour inside it. BOLD AND ITALIC inside a short support line that was a
plain string. And ONE WORD of a heading in the accent colour. Plus the layout
half: how many cards across, and which side the picture is on.

### The five rules that make it safe

1. **A surface is a designed PAIR, never a picker.** Every option is a
   background bundled with the ink and the link colour that belong on it. There
   is no hex entry and no colour wheel, so an editor cannot produce an
   unreadable band. `src/lib/surfaces.ts` is the one place the classes, the
   Studio swatch literals and the gate all read.
2. **The contrast gate resolves the REAL tokens, in BOTH themes.** The test
   parses `src/styles/globals.css`, walks `@theme` / `@theme inline` / `:root`
   for light and `.dark` for dark, follows `var()` aliases, and measures every
   pair: AA 4.5:1 for body, headings and links, 3:1 for the accent as a mark. It
   also pins the literal hexes the Studio draws with to the resolved tokens, so
   a rebrand cannot leave the swatch row showing colours the site abandoned.
   **If a pair fails, fix the pair. Never lower a threshold.**

   This rule described `surfaces.test.ts` and, until 2026-09-06, ONLY
   `surfaces.test.ts`. It was written as though the technique were universal in
   this repo; it was not, and card 9's own gate was reading tokens with a single
   unscoped `matchAll` that could silently measure the dark value and assert it
   as a light pair. The reader now lives in `src/lib/css-tokens.ts` and both
   gates import it, so the rule is true of both. The scope each gate passes it
   still differs on purpose: see card 9.

3. **The default emits NO class.** The house accent returns `null` from
   `accentClass()` and the original tone values emit exactly the strings they
   always did, so every already-published section renders byte-identical HTML.
   `scripts/page-parity.mjs compare` at zero diffs is the standing proof, and it
   is the acceptance test for this card in any repo.
4. **Rich text arrives as a TWIN, not a migration.** The plain string field
   keeps its name, its type and its stored value; a sibling `<name>Rich`
   portable-text field allows `strong` and `em` and nothing else. The plain
   field hides only once the twin holds text; the renderer prefers the twin.
   A dataset with no twins is a dataset that renders exactly as before.
5. **Headings get ONE accent.** The colour accent is the sibling of the script
   accent, and where both exist the script accent wins and the colour one is
   skipped. Two accents in one heading is decoration.

### The stega trap (the bug class this card exists to avoid)

`headingAccent` is matched against the heading with `indexOf`. In the
Presentation preview both strings arrive carrying an invisible run of Unicode
tag characters, so a naive match never fires and the accent silently does
nothing IN PREVIEW ONLY. Two defences, and you want both: `heading-accent.ts`
strips both sides with `plain()` (that helper also runs on the live site, where
the NON_STEGA list does not exist), and `headingAccent` goes on
`NON_STEGA_FIELDS` in `src/lib/cms-preview.ts`. Every new enum from this card
(`accent`, and `tone`'s new values) goes on that list too, and `accent` goes on
`extraSettingKeys` in `src/sanity/pageBuilderConfig.ts` — it ships with an
`initialValue`, so counted as content it would make card 25's "nothing typed
here" check permanently silent.

The accepted cost, stated plainly: on a heading that HAS an accent word, the
cleaned string is what renders, so click-to-edit on that one heading stops
working in the preview. Every other field still works, and the live site is
unaffected because it never carries stega at all.

### The layout half

`src/lib/layout-variants.ts` is a REGISTRY, not a formula, and that is the
point: the grids in one repo do not agree with each other about where a phone
stops stacking, so collapsing them into a formula moves live pages. Each entry
carries its section's real class strings verbatim, plus `baseColumns` (the
unprefixed grid class the component itself carries) and `phoneColumns`. The test
replays the two together for every option and fails if any option changes what a
320px phone renders — which is what lets an existing reflow sweep stand in for
the non-default values. A drift test re-derives `baseColumns` from the `.astro`
source so the copy cannot go stale. DENSITY is documented, never duplicated:
whatever padding knob the repo already has is the density control.

### THE RIGHT-CLICK DISCOVERY

The in-canvas section verbs from card 17 — insert (with the picture picker),
duplicate, move, remove — live on **RIGHT-CLICK inside the section outline**,
plus a draggable tag at the outline's corner. Hovering only outlines. Three
passages in presacademy's guide promised a hover toolbar that does not exist,
which is exactly why a real editor could not find the controls; corrected
2026-08-28 after that report. **Any guide that teaches card 17 must teach the
right-click gesture and the corner drag tag by name.** Verified live in the
deployed Studio.

### The curly-apostrophe gotcha (a build break, not a nit)

Guide copy in `src/sanity/guides/content.tsx` lives in SINGLE-quoted string
literals and the file's convention is curly quotes. A straight `'` typed inside
one of those strings terminates it and breaks the build. presacademy shipped
exactly that and needed a follow-up commit. Write `outline’s`, not `outline's`.

### Adapting it to a repo that has no shared shell

The accent needs one element to hang a class on. In a repo where every section
paints its own `<section>` and a renderer owns an automatic surface cadence
(this starter), there is nothing to hang it on and no per-section colour field is
allowed anyway — see `CLAUDE.md` #9. So here the card lands PARTIAL and
honestly: `surfaces.ts` formalises the surfaces the cadence already assigns and
gates them, the heading accent is one fixed brand colour (the editor picks the
WORD, not the colour), the rich twins and the layout registry land in full, and
there is no surface swatch, no accent enum and no `SwatchInput.tsx`. Do not
"fix" that by adding a tone field: it would break the cadence the renderer
exists to protect.

**On `SwatchInput.tsx` being per-repo:** the component SHAPE is identical
everywhere; only the dot map is brand-specific. It could be canonicalised by
taking the two maps as props. Left per-repo until a third repo wants it; the
seam is the two `*Swatches` adapters and the two exported wrappers.

**Applied to:** presacademy yes (origin) / WCP partial (it has the emphasis
layer — `emphasisText` + `emphasis.ts` with `stegaClean` — and its section
colour knobs predate this card, so surfaces/accents there are an ancestor form,
not this one) / starter yes (partial by design, see above) / church-starter yes
(full: six surfaces, three accents, six rich twins, five heading accents, six
column registries) / reid-design-site pending / mas-monograms pending.

## Card 27: Undo & redo (2026-08-28)

**Canonical:** `src/sanity/undoRedo.ts`, `src/sanity/components/UndoRedo.tsx`,
`src/lib/undoRedo.test.ts`

**What:** Squarespace's Ctrl+Z, in the Studio, for everything an editor does to a
draft. Two document actions ("Undo last change", "Redo") in the publish menu, and
`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` (`Cmd` on a Mac) with a page open. Not just
typing: sections added, dragged, duplicated or removed, photos swapped or
cleared, backgrounds and options changed. The gap this closes is the one an
editor notices within an hour of arriving from Squarespace: a mis-drag had no
answer short of Version history, which is five clicks and a scary word.

### The mechanism

Every mutation Sanity accepts lands in a transaction log, and each entry carries
a **mendoza patch in both directions**:

```
GET /data/history/<dataset>/transactions/<draftId>
    ?effectFormat=mendoza&excludeContent=true&excludeMutations=true
    &includeIdentifiedDocumentsOnly=true&reverse=true&limit=25
```

NDJSON, newest first, each line `{id, timestamp, author, documentIDs, effects}`
with `effects[<docId>] = {apply, revert}`. Apply `revert` to the document as it
stands and you have it as it was; apply `apply` to that and you are forward
again. This is sanity's OWN history request (`Timeline.fetchMoreTransactions`
in `sanity/lib/_chunks-es/index2.js` sends exactly these parameters, plus a
`toTransaction` paging cursor we do not need), so it needs no extra permission
and no extra token: it goes through `useClient(...).request()`, on the editor's
own session.

### The postmortem: it shipped, and it lied (2026-08-28)

The first version of this card went live on presacademy and **reported success
while changing nothing**. Worth reading before touching any of it.

**The repro.** A page open in Presentation, its background changed with an
in-canvas chip (card 28). Ctrl+Z. The toast said "Change undone" three times and
`background.tone` stayed `'chapel'` through all three.

**What the transaction log actually showed.** The draft's entire history was
FOUR transactions: one client-UUID create at 16:45:56 whose `apply` was a
whole-document literal already carrying `tone: 'chapel'` (the overlay's
`createIfNotExists` + `set`, batched into one transaction by the optimistic
actor), then three server-id transactions at 16:46:41, 16:47:21 and 16:47:24
**whose only effect was to move `_updatedAt`**. Those three were the undos. They
landed, they were not overwritten by anything, and they wrote the document back
to itself.

So the popular hypothesis — Presentation's optimistic actor holding an in-memory
snapshot and clobbering our write — was **wrong**, and the log proved it: there
were no competing transactions at all. Two ordinary bugs, both ours:

1. **A create transaction's `revert` is `[]`, an EMPTY patch, not a null
   literal. And `applyPatch(doc, [])` returns the document UNCHANGED.** The code
   detected "this transaction created the draft" by testing `applyPatch`'s result
   for `null`, which never fired. The delete branch was unreachable, so the
   "previous" document was the current one, and `createOrReplace` wrote it back.
   The unit tests passed throughout because the FAKE built create-reverts as
   `[0, null]` — the fixture encoded the same wrong assumption as the code, which
   is the real lesson: a fake that agrees with the bug proves nothing.
2. **`client.createOrReplace(doc, {transactionId})` silently ignores the id.**
   In @sanity/client, `_create` (behind `create`, `createOrReplace`,
   `createIfNotExists`) builds its body as `{mutations: [...]}` and never copies
   `options.transactionId` into it; only `_mutate` does. Every id we minted was
   dropped, the server assigned its own, and `ownTransactionIds` therefore
   recognised none of our own writes — which silently broke multi-step undo.

**The three fixes.** Absence is now read from the patch shape
(`revert.length === 0`), never inferred from `applyPatch`. Our own writes are
recorded by the id the SERVER returns, so nothing depends on the client
forwarding one. And a new honesty rule: before writing, the candidate is
compared with the current document ignoring `_updatedAt` and `_rev`, and a
transaction that would not move anything is skipped in favour of the next one
back. This feature is no longer able to say "Change undone" while the document
stands still. Re-introducing bug 1 alone now fails 8 tests.

A fourth shape exists too and is handled: a transaction with **both** patches
empty, which names the document but changed nothing about it (seen on
`drafts.homePage` in the live log). It is never a useful step back and is
skipped.

### Three findings, all verified against a live dataset before the code was written

1. **`excludeContent=false` is REFUSED.** The API answers `403 permissionDenied`
   with "This API requires excludeContent to be true". The effects come back
   regardless — `excludeContent` drops the mutation payloads, not the effects —
   so there is nothing lost, and a test asserts the flag so it cannot be flipped
   back by someone tidying.
2. **A transaction's `id` IS the `_rev` the document carries afterwards.** That
   is the whole rev guard, and it is why no extra bookkeeping is needed to know
   whether the log we just read explains the document in front of us.
3. **`_rev` MUST be stripped before `applyPatch`.** It is not part of the value
   the effects were computed against, and leaving it on shifts every field index
   in the patch: the document comes back with `_type` reading `"homePage3:54"`
   and a paragraph turned into an array of single letters. Sanity's own
   `applyMendozaPatch` does the same strip. This looks like data corruption and
   is really an off-by-one; it would be a miserable afternoon to find twice.

### The rules that make it safe

- **Drafts only, which makes it inherently publish-safe.** Only the `drafts.`
  id is ever read or written. A publish is a mutation on the PUBLISHED twin, so
  it is not in this log at all and cannot be stepped over. No special case
  needed; the scope is the safety.
- **The rev guard.** Before writing, the newest transaction touching the draft
  must have `id === draft._rev`. If it does not, something landed that we cannot
  see, and undo refuses with "Someone else edited since" rather than clobbering
  it.
- **The draft-creation edge.** If the transaction being undone CREATED the
  draft — read from `revert.length === 0`, never from `applyPatch`, see the
  postmortem — the honest undo is deleting the draft.
  That is allowed only after checking the published twin still exists. With no
  twin it refuses: "This would remove the only copy". Ctrl+Z must never be able
  to lose a document.
- **Repeated undo steps BACK, not back and forth.** Naively re-reading the
  newest transaction oscillates between two states forever, because our own undo
  is itself the newest transaction. A per-document register of the transaction
  ids we wrote, plus the originals already stepped past, makes `nextUndoTarget`
  skip both. Applying that target's `revert` to the current document is still
  correct, because each undo leaves the document in exactly the state that
  target produced. There is a test named for the oscillation.
- **Redo invalidation, in one line.** Each undo/redo records the `_rev` it left
  the document at. If the document has moved off that rev by the next call, the
  whole stack is dropped: any transaction we did not make — the editor typing, a
  colleague, a script — changes `_rev`, and the states the redo stack pointed at
  are no longer reachable by replaying `apply`.
- **The input-focus rule.** The shortcut does nothing, and calls no
  `preventDefault`, when focus is inside
  `input, textarea, select, [contenteditable="true"], [data-slate-editor]`. The
  browser's own per-field undo and the Portable Text editor's own history win
  there, which is what an editor expects. This shortcut is for everything
  outside a text box.
- **In memory, and it says so.** The stack is a module-level Map, gone on
  reload. The guide says undo is for the last few minutes and Version history is
  the deep restore.

### The active-document problem, and the pragmatic answer

The keyboard listener has to live in a `studio.components.layout` wrapper (a
plugin has no other window-level seam), and a layout wrapper cannot ask "which
document is open?" — the router shape is internal and moves between versions.

So the ACTIONS tell the layout. Both actions render whenever a document pane is
open, so `useUndoRedo(documentId)` pushes its id onto a module-level stack on
mount and splices it off on unmount; `activeDocumentId()` returns the newest,
which is what an editor means by "this one" with two panes side by side. The
listener reads it **at the moment of the key press**, not at render, so it
outlives every pane that opens under it. No document open, no shortcut: the key
press falls through untouched.

### Two deliberate deviations from the obvious design

**We do not supply transaction ids at all.** The first version minted a UUID and
passed `{transactionId}`, which reads as though it works and does not — see the
postmortem. Our own writes are now recognised by the id the SERVER assigns,
read back out of the mutation result (`returnDocuments: false` gives
`{transactionId, ...}`), which is also the document's new `_rev`. That is the id
actually in the log, so nothing depends on the client forwarding one. The
request carries `tag=undo-redo.transactions` for anyone reading the API log.

**`mendoza` is imported bare, and it is not a direct dependency.** It arrives
hoisted at `node_modules/mendoza` as a transitive dep of `sanity` (verified in
both repos before wiring). `sanity` re-exports nothing mendoza-shaped, and
importing through a transitive PATH would be worse. If a repo in the family ever
hoists it somewhere else, that repo cannot take this card until `mendoza` is
added to its `package.json` — check `node_modules/mendoza/package.json` exists
before porting.

### Installing it in a site

Copy the three canonical files, then two lines of wiring in `sanity.config.ts`:
`undoRedoShortcuts()` in `plugins`, and `UndoAction, RedoAction` appended to the
action list for the page-builder types (beside cards 24 and 25 — a page is where
a mis-drag actually costs something). Nothing schema-side changes, so no typegen
and no parity movement. Add the guide entry: it must say Ctrl+Z works OUTSIDE
text boxes, that inside a text box the text box's own undo runs, that the
shortcut is not heard over the Presentation preview (use the menu there), and
that Version history remains the deep restore.

**Known limit: the preview iframe eats the key.** A key pressed while focus is
inside Presentation's iframe goes to the iframe's window, not the Studio's, so
the shortcut is dead exactly when an editor has just used an in-canvas chip.
The two document actions are unaffected and are the reliable path. Forwarding
the key out was considered and declined: it needs a postMessage protocol between
the public preview island and the Studio layout wrapper — key handling in a
public bundle plus an origin check — for a shortcut with a working button two
inches away.

**Verified without a browser session:** the whole of the pure logic — the
request shape, NDJSON parsing, the rev guard, absence detection, target
selection, the no-op skip, stack invalidation — is unit tested (41 assertions),
and undo/redo run end to end against a miniature in-memory Sanity through the
REAL `applyPatch`. That fake is now faithful in the three ways that caused the
incident: creates carry an EMPTY revert, `_updatedAt` moves on every write, and
a caller-supplied `transactionId` is ignored. Re-introducing the create-detection
bug fails 8 tests. The live translog was read (read-only) against presacademy's
production dataset, which is where every finding here came from.

What is STILL not exercised without a Studio open, and is now in
`docs/PENDING.md`: the two actions rendering, the layout composing with an
existing `studio.components.layout`, the key press itself, multi-step undo
against a real server, and whether a whole-document `createOrReplace` is safe
while Presentation's optimistic actor holds in-flight patches for the same
draft (the log showed no sign of trouble during the incident, but that is
absence of evidence).

**Applied to:** starter yes / presacademy yes / WCP pending / church-starter
pending / reid-design-site pending / mas-monograms pending / 2ndpreschicago
pending / nixoncreativestudio n/a (no Studio).

## Card 28: The floating in-canvas control layer (2026-08-28)

**Dated 2026-08-28 (presacademy), canonicalized in the starter the same day.**
**Canonical:** `src/lib/sanity-path.ts`, `src/lib/inline-rich.ts`,
`src/lib/inline-rich-write.ts` (+ their `.test.ts`), the word-picker half of
`src/lib/heading-accent.ts`, `src/components/preview/overlay/usePopover.ts`,
`overlay/useDraftDocument.ts`, `overlay/styles.ts`
**Read card 28b next:** it is the two-way reconciliation with presacademy and
WCP, and it is where the `multiline` seam and the mark-boundary regression tests
actually landed.
**Per repo (NOT canonical, on purpose):** `src/lib/section-fields.ts` +
`src/lib/section-fields.test.ts`, `overlay/index.ts`, `overlay/tool-theme.ts`,
`overlay/HeadingAccentPicker.tsx`, `overlay/TextPopover.tsx`, and (where a repo
has one) the surface/band card

**What:** Squarespace-style popovers inside the Presentation canvas. Click a
heading and pick its accent word by clicking the word. Click a subhead and type
the new line where the line is, with bold and italic, instead of hunting for its
box in the form. Elsewhere in the family the same layer also carries a
surface/band swatch card off a handle in each section's corner.

### The five mechanics, each of which cost a real bug

1. **A custom overlay component only mounts on a node the schema resolves to a
   FIELD.** The host builds the resolver context through `getField(node)` and
   bails on `!field`, and the schema hook resolves no field for a bare array item
   (`sections[_key=="x"]`) on its own — so the resolver is never called for a
   section wrapper at all. The first version of this layer put the swatch row
   there and it never mounted. The fix is to give the control a real field to
   hang on: the renderer emits a small PREVIEW-ONLY handle inside each
   band-carrying section whose `data-sanity` names `…[_key=="x"].background`.
   The bare-item case is deliberately NOT kept as a fallback: it can never fire,
   and a branch that can never fire is a branch that will one day be trusted.
2. **Controls open on CLICK, not hover.** `activated` in this host means "in the
   viewport", so a control drawn on `activated` appears on every matching element
   on the page at once. Gate on `focused`, which is the click.
3. **A card must keep its OWN open state.** `focused` is not ours to lean on: the
   host clears it on `overlay/blur` and RECOMPUTES it on every
   `presentation/focus` the Studio sends back, keeping it only for the element
   whose path matches the Studio's focus path exactly. A card gated on `focused`
   therefore unmounts a beat after opening, while the pointer is still travelling
   toward it. What the host does NOT do is unmount the component: it renders an
   element's overlay for `activated || focused`, so the component stays mounted
   with its state intact. Hence: `focused` turning truthy OPENS the card, and only
   the close button, Escape, or an outside press may close it. The card also
   renders FLUSH to its anchor — the six pixels of gap belong to the overlay via
   `paddingTop` on the anchor box, not to `top: calc(100% + 6px)` — so the pointer
   never crosses unowned pixels on the way in.
4. **Gate twice, and the second gate is PER INSTANCE.** Carrying a field is not
   the same as honouring it. A section whose art-directed band style ignores the
   colour knob, or which is rendering a coaching placeholder rather than its real
   markup, must not be offered a control the renderer will ignore. The type check
   comes from the registry; the instance check reads the section value itself.
5. **Writes go through `useDocuments` from `@sanity/visual-editing/react`.**
   `doc.patch()` sends the mutation over the comlink to the parent Studio window,
   which applies it with the editor's own session exactly as if they had typed in
   the form. So every write lands in the DRAFT, shows in the unpublished-changes
   badge, is covered by card 27's undo, and still needs Publish — and the preview
   island never grows a token or a write client, which it must not, because it is
   public code in a public bundle.

### Stega, twice

Strip before matching and re-attach when writing. `splitHeadingWords` cleans the
heading before splitting it, so the words offered are real words rather than
words wearing an invisible payload, and the value stored is a slice of the CLEAN
string, which is what `splitHeadingAccent` will later match against. On the
instant-text side the payload is split off and concatenated back on, so a node
this layer writes to keeps the stega it arrived with and click-to-edit never
degrades (card 29).

### The drift gate

`section-fields.ts` duplicates knowledge that really lives in the schema, because
the overlay runs in the preview iframe and the schema lives in the parent window.
The duplicate is allowed only because a test measures it: `section-fields.test.ts`
parses the block libraries and fails if a section gains or loses `headingAccent`
or a rich twin without the registry being updated. It re-derives the heading FIELD
NAME too, which is the part a list could not carry — four of this template's five
accent types call their big line `headline`, not `heading`, and a control that
assumed `heading` would offer no words at all and never say why.

### The starter carries no band card, and that is the right answer

This is the honest half of the card. `CLAUDE.md` #9 and PORTS card 26: in this
template a page-builder block carries **no surface or colour field**, because
`SectionRenderer` owns the alternating band cadence so that reordering a page can
never break its rhythm. A band card needs a field to write to. Adding one to get
the control would trade an architectural guarantee for a convenience, so the
starter's card 28 is deliberately **two controls, not three**, and the drift gate
now asserts the absence: `no page-builder block carries a surface or colour
field` fails if anyone ever adds one. Do not "fix" this by adding a tone field.

The band-card STYLES still live in the canonical `overlay/styles.ts`
(`handleAnchor`, `panel`, `panelHead`, `closeButton`, `optionRow`, `optionDot`,
`groupLabel`), unused here and tree-shaken out of the bundle, because the
vocabulary belongs to the family rather than to one site and the next repo should
inherit it rather than re-derive it. Verified shaken: no string unique to those
objects survives into the built island.

### One accepted gap, stated plainly

A heading whose accent word HAS matched renders the stega-CLEANED string — that
is card 26's documented cost — so that element carries no path and the overlay
offers nothing on it. The picker is therefore the way IN to an accent and the way
to fix one that does not match (a typo'd accent leaves the heading encoded, so
the control is still there); changing a word that currently matches is still done
in the form. Closing that gap means the same preview-only-handle trick mechanic 1
describes, aimed at the heading rather than the band. It is possible and was not
done: it would need every section bridge to learn its own edit doc, which is a
wider change than this card earns.

### Per-repo adaptation, and the seams left for a fold-back

`tool-theme.ts` is the whole per-repo surface of the look: six values — paper,
ink, muted, line, shadow, font — that `styles.ts` draws everything from. That
split is new here; presacademy and WCP each bake the palette into their copy of
`styles.ts`, which is precisely what stopped the file being shared. `sanity-path.ts`
got the same treatment: presacademy's ancestor baked its two page-builder array
names into a module constant, so `readSectionPath` now TAKES the names and the
repo's list lives in `section-fields.ts`. Same move card 22 made on
`redirects.ts`, for the same reason.

**Left per-repo, with the divergence noted for a later fold-back:** the two card
components. presacademy and WCP's copies are structurally the same file and differ
in three ways — the label strings ("Colour a word" / "Underline a word"), the
selected-state colour, and which registry helper they call
(`headingAccentFieldFor` + `readSectionPath` on presacademy, a single
`resolveAccentTarget` on WCP). The starter takes WCP's `resolveAccentTarget`
shape, which is the more general one: it returns the heading path AND the accent
path, so a repo whose accent lives inside a nested object needs no second code
path. Folding the components themselves together would mean passing the two label
strings and one colour as props; worth doing when a fourth repo wants them,
not before.

**Applied to:** presacademy yes (origin, reconciled onto the canonical copies
2026-08-28 - card 28b) / WCP yes (full, band card included; same reconciliation,
same day) / starter partial by design (see above) / church-starter yes (all three
controls) / reid-design-site partial (its own two cards, a script-accent picker
and a layout card, on the canonical hooks and styles) / mas-monograms partial
(text card only) / 2ndpreschicago pending / nixoncreativestudio n/a.

## Card 29: Instant preview text (2026-08-28)

**Dated 2026-08-28 (presacademy), canonicalized in the starter the same day.**
**Canonical:** `src/lib/preview-stega.ts`, `src/lib/preview-text-diff.ts`,
`src/lib/preview-text-nodes.ts` (+ their `.test.ts`).
**Per-repo wiring:** `src/components/preview/overlay/useInstantText.ts`,
`src/components/preview/overlay/timing.ts`, `src/components/preview/VisualEditingOverlay.tsx`.

The old loop, end to end: type in the Studio, Studio autosave commits, Sanity indexes
the change, the Worker's `/preview/live` listen fires, EventSource, debounce, refetch
this preview URL on the server, swap `<main>`. Every hop is small; together they were
1.5-3 seconds, and the editor spent them watching a page that still said the old thing.

The frame already holds a live copy of the draft. `<VisualEditing>` starts an
optimistic-document actor whose remote feed is the STUDIO, not Sanity: the Studio runs
its own listen at `visibility: "transaction"` and relays every mutation over the
comlink. So the frame learns about an edit before the query index has caught up, which
is exactly what the server refetch has to wait for. Watch the actor, diff the document
against the last one seen, and for every PLAIN STRING that changed write the new
characters straight into the text nodes showing it. The refetch still happens; it stops
being the thing anyone waits for.

**Three tested pure helpers are what make this safe to point at a live page**, and all
three are deliberately narrow:

- `preview-text-diff.ts` reports only plain string leaves, only when BOTH sides are
  strings, and never inside portable text (a block's marks, splits and merges move text
  between spans as you type, so patching one span can show a sentence that never
  existed). Array items are matched by `_key`, never by position, so a reorder reports
  nothing instead of reporting every string as changed.
- `preview-stega.ts` splits and reattaches the invisible `@vercel/stega` run every
  preview string carries, and decodes it to `{id, type, path}`. Hand-rolled on purpose:
  `@vercel/stega` is not a direct dependency, `@sanity/visual-editing-csm` is installed
  NESTED and does not resolve from `src/`, and the one importable utility (`stegaClean`)
  throws away the half we need. Forty lines beats a dependency.
- `preview-text-nodes.ts` writes ONLY into a node whose visible characters are EXACTLY
  the old value, and reattaches the payload it split off. So click-to-edit does not
  degrade (the node keeps its identity), an accented heading whose text was cut in two
  never matches, and a value rendered inside a longer sentence never matches. Everything
  that does not match is left for the refresh. A missed instant update is invisible; a
  wrong one is a lie about what the page says.

**Measured, deployed:** keystroke to paint went from 413ms / 1429ms (two consecutive
isolated keystrokes) to roughly 100-140ms. The swap itself costs about 4ms; everything
else is the channel, which is card 29a.

**Adapting it:** the three libs are byte-portable. The hook is not: it reads the
optimistic document API, and how a repo gets a draft snapshot differs. presacademy wraps
that in an `overlay/useDraftDocument.ts` because its in-canvas controls (card 28) also
WRITE through it; the starter only reads, so the single `getDocument().getSnapshot()`
call lives inside `useInstantText` itself. Both swallow the throw a cold frame produces
rather than warning once per keystroke.

## Card 29a: The local edit-state channel (2026-08-28)

**Canonical:** `src/lib/preview-live-draft.ts` (+ `.test.ts`).
**Per-repo wiring:** `src/sanity/components/LiveDraftBridge.tsx`, mounted from
`PreviewNavigator.tsx`; received in `overlay/useInstantText.ts`.

Card 29 made the swap cost 4ms and left a 1-2 second wait entirely UPSTREAM of it: the
actor's feed is still a listen, so an edit is autosaved, committed and made visible as a
transaction before the frame hears a word. The Studio has the answer a whole round trip
earlier, in the local document store its form writes optimistic patches into, and the
Studio and the preview iframe are same-origin. So post it across.

**The priority lesson, which is the whole card.** `useEditState(id, type, priority)`
takes the priority the local store schedules the observer at. The Studio's own
`PostMessageRefreshMutations` asks for `'low'`, because it only needs to know THAT a
document changed, eventually. This needs to know WHAT it says, now. Measured live on the
deployed Studio, 2026-08-28: under `'low'` the store coalesced isolated keystrokes into
the autosave commit, and one keystroke reached the preview in **413ms** and the next in
**1429ms** - the editor's "still a second or two". Under `'default'`: **~100-140ms**.
Use `'default'`. The 60ms trailing throttle in the bridge, not the store's scheduler, is
what keeps this cheap: a keystroke is one snapshot, a burst is one post.

**Four things keep the bridge from being a liability.** It renders null and holds no
state. It is mounted from the navigator, which is the one place inside Presentation that
already knows which page the preview is showing, and unmounted the moment that
resolution goes away. It is throttled trailing. It never throws: a missing iframe, a
cross-origin one, a frame mid-navigation are all swallowed.

**Every message is untrusted.** The island ships in the public preview bundle and
`window.addEventListener('message')` hears from any frame that cares to speak, so
`parseLiveDraft` is a rejection funnel: the origin check is the caller's, and the
envelope, the document, its `_id` and `_type` must be exactly right or the message is
dropped silently. Nothing throws and nothing logs; a hostile page learns nothing and
costs nothing. `document: null` is meaningful and sent on purpose ("this page has no
draft"), which reads as silence rather than as an edit.

**Source arbitration.** Both channels feed ONE "last document I applied" memory, and the
diff is against that memory, so a snapshot OLDER than the memory does not read as
"nothing changed" - it reads as a change BACK to the older words. The local channel is
always ahead of the actor by construction, so every actor snapshot landing mid-burst is
exactly that stale snapshot. `acceptsSource` therefore holds the actor back for
`LOCAL_LEAD_MS` (2000ms) after any local snapshot: longer than one autosave round trip,
short enough that a channel which stops (an older Studio, a preview opened outside
Presentation, the navigator not resolving the page) hands control back within one edit.
Nothing is lost when it does.

**Adapting it:** `LIVE_DRAFT_MESSAGE` is `'pa:live-draft'` and stays that way in every
repo. It is an arbitrary token whose only job is to match at both ends, and changing it
per repo would fork a file that is otherwise identical everywhere for no gain.

## Card 29b: The refresh scheduler (2026-08-28)

**Canonical:** `src/lib/preview-refresh.ts` (+ `.test.ts`).
**Per-repo wiring:** the scheduler loop in `VisualEditingOverlay.tsx`.

**The failure, measured in the deployed Studio.** With `localStorage.previewTiming = '1'`
set, a single burst of edits logged SIX overlapping soft refreshes - 1128, 1505, 1131,
1245, 1494, 1228ms - which is six concurrent server renders of the same preview URL. A
`/preview` render costs about 0.9s of Worker CPU (a public page costs about 0.1s), so six
at once is how the editor got **`Error 1102: Worker exceeded resource limits`**.

The old scheduler debounced with `clearTimeout`/`setTimeout` and nothing else. The
debounce only guarded the window BEFORE a fetch started; once one was in flight, the next
change event scheduled a fresh timer and a fresh fetch. No in-flight guard, no ceiling on
concurrency, and no test of whether an arriving response was still worth having.

**That last omission is the visible bug**, the one an editor reports as "the text I typed
appears seconds later" even though instant text logs 4-6ms:

```
t0   refresh A starts        (server will render the PRE-edit page)
t1   the edit lands, instant text writes the new words   <- page correct
t2   refresh B starts
t3   A's response arrives and replaces <main> with PRE-edit HTML
```

The words revert at t3 and only come back when B lands. With several racing, the LAST to
land can be the STALEST, so the revert outlives every retry. Instant text was never slow;
it was being undone.

**Three rules, all pure so they can be tested rather than argued about:**

1. **Single flight.** At most one refresh in flight. Change events arriving during one
   set `dirty`; that flag runs exactly ONE more refresh afterwards, not one per event.
2. **Stale discard.** Every attempt is stamped with `changeSeq` as it read at fetch
   start. If the sequence has moved by the time the response lands, that HTML predates a
   change we already know about and is not swapped in at any price. It marks the state
   dirty instead, and the follow-up renders the truth.
3. **Rate limit.** `REFRESH_MIN_INTERVAL_MS = 1200`, a floor on the interval between the
   STARTS of consecutive refreshes. **Why 1200:** a `/preview` render is about 0.9s, so
   anything below about a second means a burst is still overlapping renders - the exact
   thing that tripped the 1102. An 80ms debounce with a 0.9s render is what produced six
   at once. 1200ms leaves a real gap after a typical render instead of queueing the next
   against its tail, and costs the editor nothing perceptible because instant text is
   already showing the words. Raise it if the Worker runs hot; lowering it below the
   render time re-creates the pile-up. `REFRESH_DEBOUNCE_MS` stays 80: it only has to be
   wide enough that one autosave's two or three events share a refetch, because the
   Studio already did the "wait for the editor to stop typing" batching.

`dirty` is never dropped, only deferred, so the LAST refresh of a burst always happens
and every caller of the comlink `refresh` promise resolves (Presentation spins its
refresh button until it does).

## Card 29c: The preview morph (2026-08-28)

**Canonical:** `src/lib/preview-morph.ts` (+ `.test.ts`).
**Per-repo wiring:** the morph + fast-path branch in `VisualEditingOverlay.tsx`.

**The failure, measured in the deployed Studio.** The editor's words: the text
"disappears for a second and then reappears after another second". The instrumentation
around one keystroke found: a SINGLE keystroke produced TWO `#main` swaps about two
seconds apart (the rate-limited follow-up, deliberate); nothing was left faded, hidden or
zero-height afterwards at +0/+100/+400/+900ms across forty sampled elements, so this was
never an animation replaying; `#main` held FOURTEEN `<img>` elements and zero
astro-islands; and callbacks scheduled at +100/+400/+900ms all fired about a SECOND late,
so the main thread was blocked for roughly that long at swap time.

The cause was one line: `current.replaceWith(next)`. That throws the whole live `#main`
subtree away and inserts a freshly parsed one, so every image becomes a brand-new element
that has to be re-fetched, re-decoded and re-laid out. Both the blank-then-fill and the
main-thread block, twice per keystroke, for a page whose words instant text had ALREADY
corrected.

**Deployed after:** images rebuilt per refresh **14 -> 0**; main-thread block at swap
**~1000ms -> 12ms**; shrink/reflow events during sustained typing **-> 0**.

**The image-identity rule.** `IMAGE_SOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` is `src`, `srcset`, `sizes`
(`sizes` is in the list because it selects which `srcset` candidate is used, so writing
it can change the resource even when `srcset` has not). When both sides are the same
`<img>` pointing at the same bitmap, the morph EXCLUDES those three names explicitly. The
attribute sync already refuses to write an unchanged value, so on its own this is
redundant - it is stated as a GUARANTEE rather than a coincidence, because reusing image
elements is the single biggest reason the file exists and a future tightening of
`syncAttributes` must not be able to reintroduce a `src` write by accident. A test asserts
nothing was written to them.

**The fallback contract.** Every cap and every thrown error makes `morph` return false,
and the caller then does exactly what it used to do: RE-PARSE the response and
`replaceWith` it. Re-parse, not reuse - `to`'s children are MOVED into `from` as the walk
goes, so a bailed morph leaves `to` no longer a whole `<main>`. A morph bug can therefore
make the preview slow again, but it can never leave a half-updated page on screen.

**The fast-path skip.** `isRedundantRender(fetched, live, lastAccepted)` is plain string
equality on markup the same serializer produced. Two ways a render is known-redundant:
`fetched === live` (the page already reads as the server says) and
`fetched === lastAccepted` (the server re-rendered the same bytes, so it has NOT caught up
with what instant text has since written). Case 2 is why a skip must NOT fire the
soft-refresh event: that event is also the pending-swap memory's "the server now agrees"
signal, and firing it there would retire swaps that have not landed. Nothing further is
normalized on purpose - collapsing whitespace or sorting attributes would buy a few more
skips and risk declaring two genuinely different pages equal, and the cost of a miss is
now only a cheap morph.

**Matching:** keyed children (`id`, `data-sanity`, `data-stype`, `data-key`, most
specific first) claim their old counterpart wherever it sits, so a section reorder moves
nodes instead of rebuilding them; keyless children claim the next unclaimed KEYLESS old
child, and positional matching deliberately steps over keyed ones. `data-sanity` is the
attribute that actually carries this: every section wrapper gets one from
`src/lib/preview-edit-attr.ts`, built from the document id and the array item's `_key`.

**Adapting it:** the file is written against a minimal structural interface
(`MorphNode`/`MorphElement`/`MorphCharacterData`) rather than the DOM, the same trick
`preview-text-nodes.ts` plays with `TextLike`, so the algorithm is tested with plain
objects under `node:test`. Real `Element`/`Text` satisfy it structurally. Nothing in it is
repo-specific.

## Card 29d: Staleness counts every channel (2026-08-28)

**Canonical:** the `seen` history in `src/lib/preview-live-draft.ts` and `applyKnownChange`
in `src/lib/preview-text-nodes.ts` (both `.test.ts` covered).
**Per-repo wiring:** the `noteInstantChange` bump in `VisualEditingOverlay.tsx`, passed to
`useInstantText` as `onDocument`.

**The bug:** "half my text disappears, then a second later it comes back." It survived
cards 29b and 29c, and it had TWO causes.

**Cause one: the sequence only counted the slowest channel.** Card 29b's stale discard
compares the sequence a render was stamped with against the newest one KNOWN - and the
sequence was bumped only by the SSE change events, which fire at Sanity's transaction
visibility, about a second behind the keystroke. The instant-text path learns of the same
edit in ~100ms over the local channel (card 29a). Between those two instants a render
could START before an edit, LAND after it, and still be judged current; the morph then
wrote the server's half-typed sentence over the finished one. Fix: every document instant
text applies calls `onChange` too. **Staleness is a property of the newest KNOWN document,
not of the slowest channel that could have told us about it.** This raises the number of
DISCARDS during a burst and not the number of RENDERS - rules 1 and 3 of card 29b cap
starts at one per `REFRESH_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` however many changes arrive between them. It
marks the state dirty as well, on purpose: the server still has to render the newest text
eventually, and a discard that scheduled nothing would leave the page correct only by
instant text's grace, with structural edits unrendered.

**Cause two: the re-apply could only recognise one stale value.** After a refresh, each
pending swap was re-applied only where the node read exactly `previous`, on the reasoning
that server HTML is either up to date or still showing the value the burst started from.
It can be neither: a render that started mid-burst reads the query index at ITS OWN
instant, so its words are an INTERMEDIATE value, the sentence as it stood half a second
ago. That matched neither `previous` nor `next`, so the re-apply could not correct it and
half a sentence sat on the page until the following render.

**The value-history repair.** `PendingSwap.seen` keeps every OTHER value the field has
been seen to hold this session, oldest first, capped at `MAX_SEEN = 12` (a render is at
most a second or two behind and the local channel posts at most every 60ms, so a dozen
covers far more history than any accepted render carries). The cap eats from just AFTER
the oldest entry, because the oldest is the value the first server render of the burst is
still going to arrive holding. `applyKnownChange` writes when the node reads exactly one
of `seen` and is not already showing `next`.

**Why that is still the same promise.** The match is still EXACT, against a value the
field ACTUALLY HELD in a snapshot we diffed, and the node was matched to the field by its
stega identity, not by searching the page for words. So "this node shows a value from this
field's own past" means exactly "this node is showing a stale render of this field", and
writing the newest value is a correction, not a guess. A node showing anything else - a
transformed rendering, another editor's words, a value from before this session - matches
nothing and is left alone. A missed instant update is invisible; a wrong one is a lie
about what the page says.

`rememberSwap` stays keyed by FIELD and never by source, which is what lets the two
channels take turns on one field without either forgetting the other's work, and it drops
the entry entirely when `next` comes back around to the original `previous` (the editor
undid it): the field is level with the server, so there is nothing left to correct.

### The two operational rules this layer depends on

Neither is enforceable by a test, so they are written here.

1. **Preview pages MUST send `Cache-Control: no-store`.** These SSR responses carried no
   Cache-Control at all, so browsers applied HEURISTIC caching, and the Presentation
   iframe kept serving the PREVIOUS deploy's page - stale island hashes, new editor
   features invisible - until the cache aged out. Draft content is per-cookie anyway;
   caching it was never right. Set it on the preview route
   (`src/pages/preview/[...slug].astro`); `/preview/live` already sent it.
2. **`visibility: 'query'` on the `/preview/live` listen must never be weakened.** It is
   tempting to set `'transaction'` to make the preview feel faster. Do not. `'query'` means
   Sanity waits until the change is visible to a QUERY before signalling, which is exactly
   what the overlay does next: refetch this page from the server. A `'transaction'` event
   fires earlier, and the refetch it triggers would return data that is STILL STALE, so
   the morph would re-render the page with the OLD words - over the new ones instant text
   has already put there. The earlier signal already reaches the frame by a different
   road: the Studio relays its own transaction-visibility listen over the comlink, and
   that is what instant text listens to. This one stays slow on purpose.

## Card 28a: Two fixes back from ncs-church-starter (2026-08-28)

Card 28's canonical files were written here and ported into `ncs-church-starter`
in the same afternoon. Porting them found two things this repo had not, and both
were fixed HERE and re-synced outwards rather than being patched downstream.

**1. `normalizeRuns` stored a double space across a mark boundary.**
`src/lib/inline-rich-write.ts`. The merge step collapses `"a "` + `" b"` to one
space only when the two runs carry the SAME marks, because that is the branch
that concatenates them. `<b>a </b><i> b</i>` cannot merge, so the collapse never
saw the pair and the twin stored two spaces. The rule now also applies across a
boundary, dropping the space from the SECOND run - a leading space inside an
emphasised span renders as an over-long underline or a wide bold, so it belongs
to the run that is not emphasised. Covered by a new case in
`inline-rich-write.test.ts` (418 tests here, was 417).

Church's own copy of the function had reached the same fix independently and by
a different route: it also pushed an UNMARKED space for a `<br>` inside a
`<strong>`, which is worse - `<b>a<br>b</b>` then stores three spans instead of
one. This repo's `pushText(' ')` (which inherits the current marks) is the right
call and was kept; only the boundary rule was taken.

**2. `styles.ts` gained a `note` style.** A short muted paragraph inside a panel,
where a group of rows would otherwise be. Church needs it because its surface
card has to say WHY it is offering nothing on a section with a background photo:
that section paints white text over the picture and never wears its surface
classes. Unused here, like `panel`/`optionRow`/`optionDot` and for the same
stated reason - the vocabulary belongs to the family, and the bundler drops what
nobody imports.

**Also confirmed from church's side, no change needed:** `readSectionPath`'s new
`arrayFields` parameter is exactly what church required (it has TWO arrays,
`flexibleSections` and `sections`), and the `tool-theme.ts` seam let church swap
in its own six values without touching `styles.ts`. Both generalizations paid for
themselves on their first port.

**What church does NOT share, correctly:** it has three controls, not two. Card
26 gave every shell-aware block a `background` object with a `tone` and an
`accent`, so a surface card there has a real field to write to; this template
still has none by design (CLAUDE.md #9). `section-fields.ts`, `overlay/index.ts`,
`overlay/tool-theme.ts` and the card components stay per-repo.

## Card 28b: presacademy and WCP reconciled onto card 28 (2026-08-28)

Card 28 shipped on presacademy and WCP FIRST, and only then were the shared
pieces canonicalized here. So the two repos that INVENTED the layer were the two
carrying the only un-canonical copies of it, and `sync-check` could not see them
at all: 33 marked files in presacademy and 16 in WCP against church's 50. That is
the shape a library of record is supposed to make impossible, and it is why this
card exists.

**Canonical after this pass** (marked in the starter, presacademy and WCP):
`src/lib/sanity-path.ts`, `src/lib/inline-rich.ts`, `src/lib/inline-rich-write.ts`,
`src/lib/heading-accent.ts`, `src/components/preview/overlay/usePopover.ts`,
`overlay/useDraftDocument.ts`, `overlay/styles.ts`. Marked counts went 33 -> 42
(presacademy) and 16 -> 21 (WCP; its two deliberate, self-documenting drifts in
`UndoRedo.tsx` and `shareDraftLink.tsx` are unchanged and still expected).

### The bug the reconciliation was really for

`normalizeRuns` stored a DOUBLE SPACE across a mark boundary - card 28a, fixed
here and in church that same afternoon, and still broken in BOTH origin repos
until now. presacademy's copy had no boundary handling whatsoever.

**WCP shared the bug**, by a different route. Its `normalizeRuns` had been
rewritten around lines rather than around one merge loop, and the merge inside a
line still only fired for runs with IDENTICAL marks, so `<b>a </b><i> b</i>`
walked straight past it exactly as presacademy's did. Neither repo had a case for
it. Both do now: presacademy took the canonical `inline-rich-write.test.ts`
verbatim (it runs `node --test`, like the starter), and WCP has its own vitest
case, `drops a double space that meets ACROSS a mark boundary`, which asserts the
run list AND the `htmlToRuns` path that produced it.

### WCP's multi-line handling came UP, not away

This is the half that is not tidying. WCP's `emphasis-write.ts` was more capable
than the canonical file, not less: it was RUN_BREAK-aware, so `bold\nitalic` kept
its two lines and its two marks. That is not a fork to flatten - `emphasisHtml`
there joins stored blocks with `<br />`, so a volunteer who typed two lines in
the form HAS two blocks, and collapsing them would have deleted a line break the
moment anybody opened the in-canvas card. The starter's one-paragraph rule is
equally right for the starter, whose reader joins blocks with a space.

So the behaviour became a SEAM rather than a fork, the third one on this card
after `arrayFields` and `tool-theme.ts`:

- `RUN_BREAK` (a plain `'\n'`) moved into the canonical `inline-rich.ts`, where a
  reader that emits breaks and a writer that stores them can both see it.
- `RichWriteOptions.multiline` is **off by default**, so the starter, church,
  presacademy, reid and mas keep byte-identical behaviour and byte-identical test
  output. WCP's `TextPopover.tsx` passes `{ multiline: true }` at both call sites.
- `normalizeRuns` took WCP's line structure and the starter's boundary fix. With
  no break in the input it is exactly the old single-paragraph function; with
  breaks it trims each line and drops blank ones.
- `runsToInlineRich` is now one block per line, which is one block when there is
  no break. `runsToHtml` renders a break as `<br>`.

**One latent bug was fixed on the way in.** WCP's version SPLIT run text on
`'\n'`, so a run whose text merely CONTAINED a newline - source formatting
between two tags, or a pretty-printed Word paste - became two lines. Only a run
whose WHOLE text is `RUN_BREAK` is a break now, `htmlToRuns` squeezes whitespace
as it pushes text so it can never accidentally emit one, and the plain-text half
of a paste goes through a new `textToRuns(text, options)` instead of leaning on
the collision. Covered in both suites.

### What did NOT move, and why that is the answer

- **The canonical `styles.ts` was not changed at all.** reid-design-site and
  mas-monograms carry it, `usePopover.ts`, `useDraftDocument.ts` and
  `sanity-path.ts` too, so any edit to those four would have put five repos into
  drift to serve two. presacademy and WCP took the canonical copies as they
  stand, and each got a `tool-theme.ts` holding its own six values. The visible
  cost is three touches of Studio-only chrome (a selected row's rule, a hover
  tint, a filled button), which is what the six-value seam is FOR.
- **WCP's two extras stayed per-repo**, exported from its `tool-theme.ts` and
  spread onto the canonical styles by its own card components: `TOOL_ACCENT` (the
  brand navy for a selected state) and `dialogReset` (its cards are real
  `<dialog open>` elements and reset the user-agent layout). Two repos wanting an
  accent value is evidence, not a mandate; fold it into `ToolTheme` as an OPTIONAL
  field the day a third does, so no sibling's `tool-theme.ts` has to change.
- **`optionDot` kept its canonical `(background, size)` shape.** WCP passed a
  `{dot, dotDark}` band object; it now computes the split-fill gradient in a local
  `dotFill()`, which is the move church already made and documented.
- **WCP's word picker was NOT extracted into `heading-accent.ts`.** It lives in
  `src/lib/emphasis.ts` beside a `splitHeadingAccent` that is a different function
  from this repo's (`HeadingAccentParts | null`, and a 24-character cap), rendered
  through by two public `.astro` components. Splitting that module to share forty
  lines would have touched PUBLIC OUTPUT, which this pass was not allowed to
  change. WCP's `splitHeadingWords` is also the better one - it refuses to OFFER a
  word its own matcher would refuse to match - but that improvement is tied to a
  cap this template does not have, so porting it up would add a knob nobody here
  turns. presacademy's `heading-accent.ts` differed only in comments and took the
  canonical copy.

### The rename, and why it was required rather than tidy

WCP's write half was called `emphasis-write.ts`. `sync-check` matches by PATH, so
a marked file at a different path reports MISSING-IN-STARTER forever; the file had
to become `src/lib/inline-rich-write.ts` to be covered at all. The fallout was
three import sites (`TextPopover.tsx`, `section-fields.ts`, and the test), plus
one comment in `emphasis.ts` and one link in `docs/PAGE_BUILDER.md`.

The READ half was NOT renamed, and should not be. `emphasis.ts` is imported by
fourteen files, holds `emphasisHtml` and the heading accents, and is named after
the schema type (`emphasisText`) that it reads. Instead WCP gained a 40-line
`src/lib/inline-rich.ts` that re-exports `RUN_BREAK`, `emphasisRuns as
inlineRichRuns` and `InlineRun` from it, plus the two structural block types.
That is the specifier the canonical writer imports, so the seam is a rename and
not a second implementation. It is deliberately UNMARKED: it is an adapter, and
an adapter claiming to be canonical would report drift forever.

### Tests do not travel, and the docs now say so

The starter and presacademy run `node --test`; WCP runs vitest. So a canonical
`.test.ts` can be adopted verbatim in presacademy and never in WCP. WCP keeps its
own suites for `sanity-path` and `inline-rich-write`, unmarked, which is the rule
its `docs/TESTING.md` already wrote down for the seven `preview-*` suites.

**Verified:** starter `npm test` 418 -> 425, 0 fail; church 449, 0 fail, still
50 SAME / 0 drift. presacademy `tsc` 8 errors before and after (all pre-existing),
`npm test` 452 -> 464 0 fail, build green, `page-parity compare` 13/13 PASS,
sync-check 42 SAME / 0 drift. WCP `tsc` 1 error before and after (pre-existing),
`npm run test:unit` 709 -> 713 0 fail across 45 files, `npm run check` exit 0,
`npm run format:check` clean, build green, `page-parity compare` 27/27 PASS,
sync-check 19 SAME / 2 expected drift. Its preview island
(`VisualEditingOverlay`) went **23,389 -> 23,604 bytes raw, 8,633 gzipped: +215
bytes** for the seam, the two new helpers and a `tool-theme.ts` - measured by
stashing the change, rebuilding, restoring, and rebuilding again. Nobody but an
editor in draft mode ever downloads it, and 27/27 parity says the public pages
did not move by a byte.

## Sync sessions

A sync session is a pass over one repo: run `sync-check`, reconcile drift, install the
cards that repo should have, add the PORTABLE marker to its canonical copies, and tick
the matrix.

### 2026-08-27: starter established as the library of record

Installed in `ncs-astro-sanity-starter`: `scripts/with-workerd.mjs`,
`scripts/free-dist.mjs`, `scripts/page-parity.mjs` (parameterized html root plus route
auto-discovery) with baselines in `scripts/.parity/`, `scripts/lib/sanity-lib.mjs`
(reconciled onto the existing `loadEnv.mjs`), `src/lib/contrast.ts` with
`src/lib/theme-tokens.test.ts`, the stale-types guard in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and
the new `scripts/sync-check.mjs`. PORTS.md created with cards 1-15 and the matrix above.

Verified: parity capture / rebuild / compare 9/9 PASS; `sync-check` self-check 6/6 SAME;
`npm run check` green.

Cross-check run from presacademy with `NCS_STARTER_DIR` set: **no marked files found**,
as expected, because presacademy's copies predate the marker. presacademy needs a sync
session whose first act is adding the marker line to `scripts/with-workerd.mjs`,
`scripts/free-dist.mjs`, `scripts/page-parity.mjs`, `scripts/lib/sanity-lib.mjs` and
`src/lib/contrast.ts`, after reconciling each against this repo's now-canonical version
(page-parity and sanity-lib both changed on the way in, so those two will report DRIFT
the moment the marker lands). No presacademy files were modified in this session.

WCP has a parallel session porting the parity harness, the stale-types guard, and the
backup and uptime workflows; those four cells read "yes" until it lands.

WCP session outcome notes (2026-08-27): backup/uptime/stale-types
guard/parity all landed. Adaptations recorded on their cards: Sanity
6.4 has no `schema extract --force` and multi-workspace repos need
`--workspace`; typegen config lives in sanity-typegen.json; the
parity harness is a PATTERN, not an identical-canonical file (WCP
added Instagram normalizer rules and an env-divergence gotcha: the
Playwright webServer builds with fake tracker ids, so compare only
against a plain build). The workflow-level working-directory default
breaks no-checkout gate jobs; scope defaults to the export job.

Family-wide sweep completed 2026-08-27/28: every repo had its first
sync session (reid, mas-monograms, 2ndpreschicago, church-starter,
nixoncreativestudio, plus presacademy's marker session). Adaptation
notes earned along the way, now part of the cards' lore:

- reid's Playwright CI job must build with REAL Sanity ids (its
  hidden-route stubs derive from live sectionVisibility data); the
  suite passed 140/140 and gates for real.
- Multi-hop origins (nixoncreativestudio: apex 301 -> www 307 ->
  slash) need curl -sSL in uptime; single-hop sites pin literal 200s
  on trailing-slash paths.
- Templates gate backup on a SANITY_PROJECT_ID variable instead of a
  hardcoded id, schedules commented for forks (church-starter).
- mas-monograms' new stale-types guard caught a REAL stale-types bug
  on its first run (studioGuide video fields).
- Cutover watch: secondpreschicago.org AND reiddesignllc.com still
  serve from Squarespace; their SITE_URL variables wait for DNS.
- loadEnv.mjs is now PORTABLE-marked here (this commit). The five
  downstream Sanity repos carry the unmarked copy; each pulls the
  marked version forward at its next session (church-starter's
  PENDING documents why marking downstream-first is wrong).

### 2026-08-28: the starter takes the full modern stack (cards 1, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17)

The template upgrade card 17's rollout plan called for, done in one session and gated per
phase: Astro 6.3 to 7.2 with `@astrojs/cloudflare` 14.2.4 and wrangler `~4.110.0`; the
Sanity 6.4 pin set; the nested `studio/` package folded into the root and embedded at
`/studio`; the preview stack; and the in-canvas section controls. Full detail is in
`docs/agent/changelog.md`; the reusable lessons are folded into cards 1, 10, 11, 13, 14
and 17 above rather than repeated here.

Gate results: `npm run build` green, `npm test` 94/94, `npm run parity compare` 10/10
twice, `sync-check` self-check 7/7 SAME (no canonical file needed changing), one
`@sanity/ui` on disk, one `errors.md#` chunk, typegen byte-stable, and `wrangler dev`
serving `/`, `/about/` and `/studio/` with the Studio mounting in a real browser.

Parity baselines were re-captured **twice**, both times with the diff classes enumerated
first: once for the Astro 7 upgrade (generator string, island uid, minifier output,
text-node whitespace) and once for a `sonner`/react-aria attribute that arrived with a
clean lockfile re-resolve. Nothing structural moved in either.

**What is NOT verified here, and what the next repo should do differently:** this
template has no Sanity project, so the preview could only be proven to fail closed
(503 naming the missing config; `/preview/live` 403 without the Studio cookie). Rendering
a real draft, the click-to-edit overlay, and the in-canvas controls need a configured
project and a `SANITY_TOKEN`. A site repo installing this card should run that check for
real, in a browser, before ticking its cell.

**Next in card 17's order:** reid-design-site (already Sanity 6, shortest hop), then
mas-monograms, then 2ndpreschicago after its DNS cutover. ncs-church-starter should
inherit most of this by sync from here rather than by a fresh port.

### Card 10/17 rollout complete (2026-08-28, late)

Every Sanity repo except 2ndpreschicago (parked for DNS cutover) now
carries the modern stack. "staged" = verified and pushed to a
`staging` HOLDING BRANCH because those repos auto-deploy from main
via Cloudflare Workers Builds; the dashboard deploy command must
become `npx wrangler deploy -c dist/server/wrangler.json` BEFORE the
merge, or every SSR route 404s. reid additions to the lore:
sanity-plugin-iframe-pane floats a third @sanity/ui by caret (drop it,
presentationTool supersedes it); pass a per-request client into query
functions with the memo skipped so draft reads never leak between
Worker requests; and verify surprising upstream markup changes in a
real browser before pinning (radix accordion's dropped aria-controls
was deliberate and axe-clean).

### 2026-08-28 (later): edit-mode gate + sticky page-list navigation

Two editor reports from presacademy, fixed and rolled to every
Presentation repo (presacademy, wcp, starter, church-starter [layout
only - no navigator], reid + mas staging branches):

1. Edit-mode gate in PreviewLayout's interceptor (see Card 11's
   amendment).
2. STICKY navigation in PreviewNavigator: a page-list click during a
   preview page load was silently dropped, because Presentation can
   only hand the iframe its next URL once the new page's
   visual-editing script reconnects. The navigator now records the
   click's intent, highlights the row immediately, and re-issues
   navigate() every 750ms until params.preview reports arrival (~6s
   cap). When the first navigate lands, `current` matches at once and
   no retry ever fires.

Verified on the presacademy build: an edit-mode click on a CTA leaves
the URL untouched; the same click without overlay boxes remaps into
/preview/*.

### 2026-08-28 (later still): the chrome joins the preview as a template part

The preview shell renders the REAL Header and Footer around every
page (they were chrome-less only because header links used to bounce
the iframe onto the live site - the click interceptor closed that
hole). siteSettings is fetched draft-aware in PreviewLayout so chrome
edits live-update. Each piece is wrapped in a data-sanity attribute
via the new docEditAttr(id, type, path) helper in preview-edit-attr:
the WordPress-template-part gesture. In Edit mode the header/footer
outline as editable surfaces and a click opens the owning document in
the edit panel. Applied to presacademy (header->title,
footer->mission), wcp (header->the navigation doc's mainNav,
footer->siteSettings; its chrome already rendered via linkBase),
starter, church-starter, reid + mas staging (all
header->siteSettings.title, footer->tagline). Headers/Footers accept
an optional siteSettings prop with clean fallbacks in every repo, so
a null fetch can never blank the chrome.

### 2026-08-28: card 18 lands in both templates (chrome options)

Card 18 ported from presacademy (canonical) into the starter and
church-starter in one pass. Each got the shared `navLink` type
(registered in schemaTypes/index.ts), `src/lib/nav-href.ts` carrying
its OWN singleton -> live-path map, the dereferencing
NAV_LINK_PROJECTION plus an exported SITE_SETTINGS_PROJECTION that
PreviewLayout now fetches through, and the chrome fallbacks pulled out
of Header/Footer into resolveSiteSettings. New Site Settings fields in
both: headerCta {show,label,link}, legalNav, logo (image + alt),
showEmail, showSocials, showFooterSocials; navItems and footerColumns
were REUSED, with the inline navLink member swapped for the shared
type and the legacy footerLink kept beside it.

Three adaptation notes worth carrying to the next repo:

- **The starter's resolver is chrome-only.** church-starter already had
  a `resolveSiteSettings` covering identity/contact/social, so the
  menus joined it. The starter had no such module, so the new one
  resolves the chrome and nothing else; its Header/Footer still read
  identity fields off the raw document. Folding those in is a separate,
  parity-risky change.
- **Two fallbacks stayed in the components on purpose**: the starter's
  footer columns (per-link module-visibility flags) and both footers'
  legal rows (links with different link styles). They resolve to an
  empty array and the component keeps its built-in markup. See the
  centralized-fallback rule on the card.
- **The header's max menu length is per-repo.** presacademy and the
  starter cap navItems at 6; church-starter's own built-in menu is
  seven entries wide, so it caps at 7. Capping below a repo's own
  default menu would be a validation error nobody could satisfy.

Both repos verified green: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (TS5101 baseUrl
deprecation only), `npm run build` clean, `node scripts/page-parity.mjs
compare` 10/10 (starter) and 20/20 (church), unit tests pass, and
`sanity schema extract --enforce-required-fields` succeeds. The parity
run is what caught the SanityImage-import CSS-bundle rename recorded on
the card. Baselines were NOT regenerated in either repo.

### 2026-08-28: publishing confidence lands in both templates (cards 19 + 20)

Unlocked Studio Phase E, written here first and installed in
church-starter in the same pass. Three files are byte-identical
across the two repos and PORTABLE-marked here:
`src/sanity/components/shareDraftLink.tsx`,
`src/sanity/schemaTypes/_publishAt.ts`, `scripts/publish-due.mjs`.
The fourth, `.github/workflows/publish-due.yml`, differs only in the
paragraph naming which template it is sitting in.

Three adaptation notes for the next repo:

- **church-starter has no PreviewNavigator.** The share affordance is
  therefore the document action alone there, which is why the module
  was written as a `useShareDraftLink()` hook with the action beside
  it rather than as navigator markup. The starter, which does have a
  navigator, calls the same hook from a per-row button. Any repo
  gains the navigator button by adding one `<Button>`; none of them
  needs a navigator to get the feature.
- **Where the field went, and where it did not.** Both repos put the
  group/field pair on `page` and on their page-singleton factory. In
  church-starter that factory backs all eleven church page
  singletons, so coverage is broad. In the starter the factory is
  currently uncalled (every core singleton is hand-authored), so only
  `page` carries the field in practice. Hand-authored singletons in
  either repo do NOT have it yet; adding it is spreading
  `PUBLISH_AT_GROUP` into that type's `groups` and `publishAtField()`
  into its `fields`, together, and nothing else. The script never
  needs to know.
- **The dry-run could not be exercised against real data.** Neither
  template has a `.env` or a Sanity project, so `publish-due.mjs` was
  proven only to parse, to fail closed on a missing project id and on
  a missing token, and to keep the token out of every message. The
  first fork to enable this should run the bare (dry) form against a
  real dataset with one scheduled draft before uncommenting the cron.

Both repos verified green: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (TS5101 baseUrl
deprecation only), `npm run typegen` re-run and committed,
`npm run build` clean, `node scripts/page-parity.mjs compare` 10/10
(starter) and 20/20 (church) - nothing here touches built HTML - unit
tests 94/94 and 60/60, and `sanity schema extract
--enforce-required-fields` succeeds in both with `publishAt` present
and optional. Prettier reformatted `page.ts` in both repos and
`_pageSingleton.ts` / `churchPages.ts` beyond the edited lines; those
files had drifted from `npm run format` before this session.

### 2026-08-28: Pages as first-class objects, in both templates (cards 21, 22)

Installed in `ncs-astro-sanity-starter` (canonical) and
`ncs-church-starter`: `src/lib/redirects.ts` + `redirects.test.ts`,
`src/sanity/pageOps.ts`, `src/sanity/components/pageActions.tsx`,
`src/sanity/components/slugRedirect.tsx`,
`src/sanity/components/SeoSnippetInput.tsx`,
`src/sanity/schemaTypes/_seoFields.ts` (all seven PORTABLE-marked and
byte-identical across the two repos), plus a per-repo
`schemaTypes/redirect.ts`, the `archived` + Search & sharing wiring on
each `page` type, a Redirects list under Pages in each desk structure,
the build-time redirect and hidden-page reads in each
`astro.config.mjs`, and the actions wiring in each `sanity.config.ts`.
The starter additionally grew the per-row "..." menu and the
**Archived** group in `PreviewNavigator.tsx`; the church starter has
no navigator and takes the document actions alone, which is the
complete feature.

The reference implementation was WCP's, and three things were
deliberately NOT copied straight across:

- **`redirects.ts` lost the doc-type-to-path map.** WCP's version owns
  `pathForPageSlug` / `pathForPostSlug` / `pathForDocSlug`. Both
  templates already have that map, per repo, in
  `src/sanity/urls.ts` (`pathForDoc`), so the canonical file keeps only
  the pure path arithmetic and the publish action asks `pathForDoc`
  instead. That is what makes both `redirects.ts` and
  `slugRedirect.tsx` byte-identical in repos whose routes have nothing
  in common, and it removed the need for a `SLUG_REDIRECT_TYPES` list.
- **The verbs were pulled out of the navigator into `pageOps.ts`.** In
  WCP they live inside `PreviewNavigator.tsx`. The church starter has
  no navigator, so a navigator-only feature would have been
  church-shaped as "not available". Splitting logic from surface gave
  the church the full feature through document actions and gave the
  starter both surfaces from one implementation.
- **Menu drag was skipped in both, on purpose (mission call).** WCP's
  navigator can drag a page into the header menu because WCP's menu is
  a `navigation` singleton of page references. In these templates the
  menu is `siteSettings.navItems`, already fully editable in Site
  settings, and the navigator's groups are publication-state groups,
  not menu-membership groups. A drag target would have had to be
  invented rather than ported.

Adaptation notes earned on the way:

- **`archived` reaches the live site through four queries, not one.**
  `getAllPageSlugs` (so the route is never built), the nav link
  projection plus `navHref` (so a menu link to an archived page is
  dropped instead of pointing at a 404), and the sitemap read in
  `astro.config.mjs`. Every test is `archived != true`, never
  `archived == false`.
- **Patching both twins needs a presence check first.** A patch against
  a missing document id fails the whole transaction, so
  `setPageArchived` looks up which of `<id>` / `drafts.<id>` exist
  before building it. WCP's navigator got this right by carrying
  `hasDraft` / `hasPublished` on each row; a function with no row to
  read has to ask.
- **`hideFromSearch` was added only to `page`, not to the page
  singletons.** The singletons' SEO fields are hand-authored per type
  and nothing on the routes reads a `noindex` from them yet; a switch
  with no second half is a dead control, which is exactly what
  `_seoFields.ts`'s header warns against. The starter's uncalled
  `_pageSingleton` factory was edited and then reverted for that
  reason. Extending it later is: pass the type's existing three SEO
  fields into `seoFields({ reuse })`, add `hideFromSearch` to that
  page's GROQ projection, pass `noindex` to `BaseLayout`, and add the
  type to the sitemap read.
- **The global `CharacterCountInput` wrapper is safe over a field-level
  custom input.** It renders `props.renderDefault(props)` untouched for
  anything without a max length, so the value-less `seoPreview` field
  reaches `SeoSnippetInput` normally. Worth knowing before adding any
  other custom input to these repos.
- **`sanity schema extract --path` is resolved relative to the repo
  root and rejects an absolute Windows path** (it tries to `mkdir`
  `<repo>\C:\Users\...`). Pass a bare filename and delete it after.

Both repos verified green: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (TS5101 baseUrl
deprecation only), `npm run lint` with no new findings (the starter's
one pre-existing error in `pageBuilder.types.ts` is untouched), prettier
clean on every edited file, `npm run build` clean, `npm run typegen`
re-run and committed, `sanity schema extract
--enforce-required-fields` succeeds in both, unit tests **106/106**
(starter, 94 + 12) and **72/72** (church, 60 + 12), and
`node scripts/page-parity.mjs compare` **10/10** and **20/20** with no
regeneration - nothing here changes rendered HTML until an editor
archives a page or ticks a switch. `sync-check` self-check in the
starter is 17/17 SAME, and the cross-check from church against the
starter is 16/16 SAME (church still does not carry the marker on
`scripts/page-parity.mjs`, which is a pattern rather than an identical
canonical file).

### 2026-08-28: sync-check learns the nested-app rule

wcp keeps its whole app under site/, so every marked file there
reported MISSING-IN-STARTER - the checker compared repo-relative
paths only. sync-check.mjs now retries a miss once with the first
path segment stripped (one segment, only on a miss, labeled in the
output as "(starter: <path>)"). First run against wcp immediately
surfaced two real drifts (free-dist / with-workerd carrying
pre-genericization em-dash comments; starter copies pulled forward)
plus the documented deliberate icons-5 drift in shareDraftLink.

### 2026-08-28: editor-defined forms land in both templates (card 23)

Both templates learned to let an editor write their own form questions,
ported from wcp's Unlocked Studio Phase D. Three new canonical files,
byte-identical in both: `src/lib/custom-form-fields.ts`, its test, and
`src/sanity/schemaTypes/formQuestion.ts`. The starter hangs the `fields`
array on `contactPage` (`formFields`) and teaches `ContactForm.tsx` to
draw the questions and fold the answers; church-starter hangs it on the
`sectionForm` page-builder block, with a new `QuestionsForm.tsx` island
beside the untouched `FormRenderer.tsx`.

Adaptation notes earned on the way:

- **The type is `formQuestion`, not `formField`.** church-starter's
  `form` document already registers a `formField` array member. Two
  schema types with one name is a browser-runtime Studio crash that
  `astro build` does not catch, and a byte-identical canonical file
  cannot rename itself per repo. Named once, for the whole family.
- **Neither template has a form API route, and neither needed one.**
  Both post client-side to Web3Forms from a React island. The lib's
  `parseCustomFieldEntries` takes an `Iterable<[string, string]>`, so
  the island synthesizes the same pairs a native POST would produce and
  the fold happens just before `fetch`. Same tested code, no route, no
  new env var. `PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_KEY` still gates delivery, and the
  keyless fallback each repo already had (inline notice in the starter,
  mailto in church) is preserved.
- **An island prop must be SPREAD, not passed, to keep parity.** Astro
  serializes island props into the rendered `<astro-island>` element, so
  passing `customFields={[]}` would change the HTML of a page with no
  questions. `contact.astro` builds `questionProps` and spreads an empty
  object instead, and parity stays zero-diff.
- **church's `sectionForm.form` reference stopped being plainly
  required.** It is now a custom rule: a Form document OR at least one
  question. A section built the old way still cannot be left empty.
- **The starter's questions replace the built-in questionnaire**
  (location, project type, budget, timeline, message, source), matching
  wcp's variant semantics. `validate()` returns early on the studio
  fields when questions exist, and the payload omits them rather than
  sending blanks.

Verified in both repos: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run build` green,
`sanity schema extract --enforce-required-fields` succeeds, `npm run
typegen` regenerates cleanly (78 and 118 schema types). Unit tests
**124/124** (starter, 106 + 18) and **90/90** (church, 72 + 18).
`page-parity compare` **10/10** and **20/20** - an empty questions array
is a zero-diff no-op, which is the proof the change is additive.
`sync-check` self-check in the starter is 20/20 SAME; from church the
three new canonical files all report SAME. One PRE-EXISTING drift
remains in church: `scripts/sync-check.mjs` never received the
nested-app rule from the session above. Untouched here, still open.

### 2026-08-28: saved sections + pre-publish checks land in both templates (cards 24 + 25)

Both templates learned wcp's Unlocked Studio Phase C and E: keep a
section and reuse it, and read a page back before publishing. Four new
canonical files, byte-identical in both (`src/lib/page-checks.ts`, its
test, `src/sanity/actions/checkPage.tsx`,
`src/sanity/actions/saveSectionPreset.tsx`), one canonical file
extended (`addSectionToPage()` joins duplicate and archive in
`src/sanity/pageOps.ts`), and two per-repo files each: the
`sectionPreset` document against that repo's own section union, and
`src/sanity/pageBuilderConfig.ts`.

**The config-object restructure is deliberate canonical evolution,
ahead of wcp's copy.** wcp's ancestor bakes its own field names and
lists into the library file, which is exactly why it could not be
shared. Card 25 carries the fold-back recipe; nothing about it is
urgent.

Adaptation notes earned on the way:

- **The section union is reused, never rewritten.** The starter's
  preset takes `[...SECTION_TYPES, ...RICH_SECTION_TYPES]` (the widest
  union in the repo, so a preset can be saved from any page);
  church-starter's takes `FLEXIBLE_SECTION_MEMBERS`. Both carry the
  repo's own `sectionArrayOptions`, so the picker inside a preset reads
  exactly like the picker on a page. A hand-written member list would
  have gone stale on the next block added.
- **`sectionLabel` had to learn both naming conventions.** The starter
  suffixes its types (`imageTextSection`), church-starter prefixes them
  (`sectionImageText`). One canonical function strips either, so both
  read "Image text". wcp, which only suffixes, is unaffected by the
  added prefix rule.
- **The insert surface is where the two repos genuinely differ, and
  splitting the verb from the surface is what let both have the
  feature.** The starter has the Presentation navigator, so it got the
  "Saved sections" group with per-row "add to the page you are looking
  at". church-starter has no navigator at all, so the same verb hangs
  on the saved section instead: "Add to a page..." with a page picker.
  Same `addSectionToPage`, opposite direction. This is the same lesson
  cards 21/22 recorded, met again.
- **`PageOpsClient` grew `createIfNotExists` and `patch`.** Both
  existing call sites cast through `as unknown as PageOpsClient`, so
  widening the interface broke nothing, and the real Sanity client
  satisfies all of it.
- **One list wires three things.** `SECTION_HOST_TYPES` in
  `pageBuilderConfig.ts` is the document-actions gate, the navigator's
  "can a saved section go here?" test, and church's page picker. In
  church that list is the generic `page` plus eighteen singletons that
  all share `flexibleSections`, so the actions resolver branches once
  on a set rather than naming types in three places.
- **The starter's `additionalSections` append zone is read by the
  checks but is never an add TARGET.** A saved section goes to the main
  builder; the checks still walk both, numbered as one list, because
  that is how the editor sees the page.
- **The navigator's live `listen` had to widen to
  `*[_type in ["page", "sectionPreset"]]`,** or a section just saved
  from a page would not appear in the panel until the tool was
  reopened.

Verified in both repos: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (TS5101 baseUrl
deprecation only), `npm run build` green, `page-parity compare`
**10/10** and **20/20** (nothing here touches rendered HTML until an
editor adds a section), `sanity schema extract
--enforce-required-fields` succeeds, `npm run typegen` regenerates
cleanly (79 and 119 schema types), `npm run lint` with no new findings
(the starter's one pre-existing `pageBuilder.types.ts` error is
untouched), prettier clean on every new and edited file. Unit tests
**150/150** (starter, 124 + 26) and **116/116** (church, 90 + 26).
`sync-check` self-check in the starter is 24/24 SAME and the
cross-check from church is 23/23 SAME, the five shared files included.
The pre-existing church drift on `scripts/sync-check.mjs` (no
nested-app rule) is still open and still untouched.

### 2026-08-28: the client offer written down

docs/CLIENT-OFFER.md states what the Unlocked Studio program lets you
promise a client, what stays locked and why that is the product, the
free-plan roles reality (Admin/Editor only; Growth unlocks custom
roles and Sanity's own scheduling - card 20 exists so scheduling does
not need it), the theme-presets default-no decision, the care plan,
and the words to avoid (requests served, not page views; one-hour
share links; count the seats).

### 2026-08-28: card 25 fold-back landed in wcp

wcp is now canonical on page-checks.ts (SAME) with its own
pageBuilderConfig.ts. Deliberately divergent there, by design, with
reasons in the file headers: the two action files (wcp's volunteer
guide quotes their labels verbatim) and pageOps (wcp's duplicate
must strip hubKey and branch hub preview hrefs; canonical pageOps
has no hub concept). Test files are per-runner everywhere: the
canonical suite is node:test, wcp's is vitest with the same cases.

### 2026-08-28: appearance controls land in both templates (card 26)

Ported from presacademy, adapted per repo. Three new canonical files
(`src/lib/inline-rich.ts`, `src/lib/heading-accent.ts`,
`src/components/InlineRich.astro`) now carry the PORTABLE marker and
report SAME in both directions; everything else is deliberately
per-repo, because the colour maps are the brand.

**church-starter got it in full.** Six surface pairs (Paper, Warm,
Bright card, Chapel green, Chapel deep, Ink — `card` and `ink` are
the additions, the four originals emit their old classes), three
accents (Bronze default/no class, Chapel green, Ink) wired once in
SectionShell so every pill and accent word follows with no per-block
colour edit, swatch chips in the Studio, six rich twins, five heading
accents, and a six-entry column registry with two new controls
(steps, dynamic list). 75-assertion contrast gate, tightest pair
5.99:1, nothing lowered. 209 tests, parity 20/20, typegen committed.
Its guide gained a "Change how a section looks" entry and — the other
half of the editor report — its `sections` guide now teaches the
right-click gesture, and the stale "there is no live preview inside
Sanity" line is gone, because there is.

**starter got it partial ON PURPOSE**, and the card says why: CLAUDE.md
#9 forbids a per-block surface field here (the SectionRenderer owns
the alternating cadence so reordering cannot break the rhythm) and
there is no shared section shell to hang an accent class on. So
`surfaces.ts` formalises and GATES the four surfaces the cadence and
the components already paint — including the shadcn `:root`/`.dark`
overrides that theme-tokens.test.ts explicitly left out — the heading
accent is one fixed brand colour with the word as the only choice,
and the rich twins and layout registry land in full through
SectionHeading.astro, which serves nearly every section at once. No
tone field, no accent enum, no SwatchInput. 208 tests, parity 10/10,
sync-check 27 SAME.

Not yet swept for this card: reid-design-site, mas-monograms,
2ndpreschicago, nixoncreativestudio. WCP stays `partial`: it has the
emphasis layer and its own older colour knobs.

### 2026-08-28: undo & redo land in both templates (card 27)

Three canonical files, byte-identical in both repos and both marked:
`src/sanity/undoRedo.ts` (the transaction-log machinery),
`src/sanity/components/UndoRedo.tsx` (two document actions plus the
keyboard plugin), `src/lib/undoRedo.test.ts` (27 tests). Wiring is two
lines per repo: `undoRedoShortcuts()` in `plugins`, and
`UndoAction, RedoAction` beside cards 24 and 25 on the page-builder
types. No schema change, so no typegen and no parity movement.

**The mechanism was established empirically, not from memory.** A
read-only dry run against presacademy's production dataset settled
three things the same morning: `excludeContent=false` is refused with a
403, a transaction's `id` is the `_rev` it leaves behind (which is the
rev guard, free), and `_rev` must be stripped before `applyPatch` or
the reverted document comes back with its `_type` reading
`"homePage3:54"`. The same dry run replayed five real transactions of
`drafts.homePage` and confirmed `apply(revert(doc)) === doc` exactly.
All three are written into the card and the file header, because the
third one in particular looks like corruption rather than an
off-by-one.

**presacademy** also gained the guide entry "Undo a change", and the
`sections` guide's see-also now points at it. The line it already
carried — "Removing a section is undoable before you publish" — is
finally true in the way an editor would read it.

**starter** got the same three files and the same wiring. Its
`sanity.config.ts` has no layout component of its own, so the plugin's
layout is the only one; presacademy's composes on top of `StudioLayout`
(fonts), which is the arrangement to watch when porting to a repo that
already wraps the layout.

Verification: 235 tests in the starter, 258 in presacademy, both
green; `tsc --noEmit` clean in both; both build; starter parity 10/10;
sync-check 30 SAME self-check and 19 SAME cross-check. presacademy's
parity harness reports 0/13, and it does so on a clean tree too
(verified by stashing) — a pre-existing baseline drift in the theme
script, unrelated to this card and still open.

What no test can reach without a Studio open: the actions rendering in
the publish menu, the plugin layout composing with an existing one, and
the key press itself. Those are the three things to click first.

### 2026-08-28: tsc was blind behind TS5101

npx tsc --noEmit stops at the TS5101 baseUrl deprecation before
checking any file, so every repo whose only type gate was bare tsc
verified nothing. Found when WCP's astro check caught a real bug in
canonical undoRedo.ts (the as-RawDoc contextual-generic trap, now
fixed canonically). tsconfigs carry ignoreDeprecations '6.0' now;
the trustworthy gate for Astro repos is astro check, and bare tsc's
leftover noise (.astro imports, cloudflare:workers types) is
environmental, not code. Follow-up decision queued: install
@astrojs/check family-wide so every repo gates like WCP.

### 2026-08-28: card 28 - the floating in-canvas layer (presacademy first)

Squarespace-style popovers in the Presentation canvas, built on the
overlay-component API (components prop on <VisualEditing>; resolver
runs only in Edit mode with the optimistic actor ready; controls
must opt into PointerEvents over the pointer-events:none layer).
Surface/accent chips on section hover, click-a-word headingAccent,
Edit-here popovers (textarea for hero fields, strong/em-only
contenteditable for rich twins with an allow-list paste tokenizer),
and preset-adds adopting the neighbour's tone (caller-side;
pageOps stays byte-exact). Writes go through useDocuments from
@sanity/visual-editing/react - comlink to the Studio, drafts always,
no browser token, covered by card 27's undo. A drift gate parses
blocks.ts so schema and registry cannot diverge silently. Live on
presacademy only; canonicalization here after Nathan's deployed
click-through. Known follow-up: canonical pageOps.ts:225 has a
type-only .commit error on PageOpsPatch that only astro check-gated
repos can see - fix at the next sync.

### 2026-08-28 (later): card 27 shipped broken, and what the log said

Undo reported success and changed nothing, three times, on deployed
presacademy. The full account is in card 27's postmortem; the short
version is that both causes were ours and neither was the one everyone
guessed.

The suspicion was that Presentation's optimistic actor was overwriting
our mutation. The transaction log for `drafts.pricingPage` refuted it
in about a minute: four transactions, one create carrying the tone, and
three undo writes whose only effect was to move `_updatedAt`. No
competing transactions at all. The undos landed; they wrote the
document back to itself.

Cause one: a create transaction's `revert` is `[]`, and
`applyPatch(doc, [])` returns the document unchanged, so the null test
that was supposed to mean "this created the draft" never fired. Cause
two: `@sanity/client`'s `_create` never forwards `options.transactionId`
into the request body (only `_mutate` does), so every id we minted was
dropped and our own writes were unrecognisable to us.

**The part worth carrying to every other card.** The unit tests were
green through all of it, because the fake built create-reverts as
`[0, null]` — the fixture encoded the same wrong assumption as the code.
A fake that agrees with the bug proves nothing. The fake is now faithful
in the three ways that mattered (empty revert on create, `_updatedAt`
moving on every write, caller transaction ids ignored), and
re-introducing cause one fails 8 tests instead of 0.

A third rule came out of it that is not a bug fix but a policy: an undo
that would not move anything other than `_updatedAt` is skipped in
favour of the next step back, so the feature cannot say "Change undone"
while the document stands still.

Both repos: 249 tests in the starter, 341 in presacademy, sync-check 30
SAME self / 19 SAME cross, no new tsc errors either side. The deployed
round trip - the actions rendering, multi-step undo against a real
server, and whether a whole-document write is safe beside the
optimistic actor - is in presacademy's `docs/PENDING.md`, along with
the leftover `drafts.pricingPage` fixture for Nathan to discard.
Ctrl+Z over the preview iframe stays a documented limitation.

### 2026-08-28 (later still): cards 29-29d canonicalized in the starter

The preview reliability and speed layer, built and proven on the deployed
presacademy Studio with measurements, brought here as canonical.

**Marked PORTABLE (14 files, byte-exact to presacademy apart from the marker
line):** `src/lib/preview-stega.ts`, `preview-text-diff.ts`,
`preview-text-nodes.ts`, `preview-live-draft.ts`, `preview-refresh.ts`,
`preview-morph.ts`, `preview-navigation.ts`, and each one's `.test.ts`. All seven
are pure: no DOM, no Sanity client, no repo names. `preview-morph` and
`preview-text-nodes` are written against minimal structural interfaces
(`MorphElement`, `TextLike`) precisely so they can be tested under `node:test`,
which has no DOM. 110 assertions came with them; the suites ported verbatim.

**Left per-repo (adapted, no marker):** `VisualEditingOverlay.tsx` (the scheduler
loop, the morph and fast-path branch, `noteInstantChange`, the bfcache
pagehide/pageshow handling), `overlay/useInstantText.ts`, `overlay/timing.ts`,
`LiveDraftBridge.tsx`, `PreviewNavigator.tsx`, `pages/preview/live.ts`,
`pages/preview/[...slug].astro`, `layouts/PreviewLayout.astro`. Each of those
either names this repo's own document types or wires into a surface whose shape
differs between sites.

**Two infra fixes travelled with them.** The `/preview/live` SSE leak: `send()`
throwing means the client went away MID-WRITE, so `cancel()` never fires; that
path used to set `open = false` and leave the read loop holding a live Sanity
listen open forever. It now closes AND aborts upstream, and `request.signal` is
wired as a third road out because it fires even while parked in `reader.read()`.
And `PreviewLayout.astro` now skips its chrome fetch when
`x-preview-soft-refresh` is present: the refetch consumes exactly `#main`, and
nothing inside `#main` reads `chromeSettings`, so the swapped HTML is
byte-for-byte what a full render produces while the render costs one fewer Sanity
round trip.

**The navigator's two-click bug is fixed here too.** The starter carried the same
sticky retry presacademy had: re-issue `navigate(sameHref)` every 750ms. That
could never work, because leaving `params.preview` at the value it already held
means Presentation's effect never re-runs and nothing is posted to the iframe.
`preview-navigation.ts` replaces it with a bounce-aware intent machine: hold the
intent THROUGH the match, watch for the flip back to the path we came from, and
re-issue on that flip - which is a real change to `params.preview`, so the host
effect does run. Capped at 4 attempts inside a 4s window.

**One real divergence — CLOSED 2026-08-28 by card 28.** presacademy's
`useInstantText` reads the draft through `overlay/useDraftDocument.ts`, which also
carries `setAt`/`setInside`/`unsetAt` and a `write()` for the card-28 in-canvas
controls, and which imports a `src/lib/sanity-path.ts` this repo did not have.
When cards 29-29d landed here the starter had no such controls and only ever
READ, so the single `getDocument().getSnapshot()` call lived inside
`useInstantText` itself and `useDraftDocument.ts` was not ported. Card 28 brought
both files in the same day, marked canonical, and `useInstantText` now takes
`readNow` from the shared hook. There is no second door to the optimistic document
in this repo any more.

**Nothing was skipped for want of a surface.** Everything on the list had an
equivalent in this repo, including the PreviewLayout chrome fetch (one here,
two on presacademy: this repo has no announcement bar).

**Verification:** `tsc --noEmit` 46 errors before and 46 after, all pre-existing
and all environmental (`cloudflare:workers`, `.astro` imports, the Sanity
`insertMenu` readonly-groups noise, and the known `pageOps.ts:225` `.commit`
type-only error card 28's entry already flags); `npm test` 249 -> 359, 0 fail;
`npm run lint` back to its pre-existing 1 error + 7 warnings, none in touched
files; `npm run build` clean; `page-parity compare` 10/10 PASS (this whole layer
is preview-only, so any parity movement would have been a bug); `sync-check`
self-check 44 SAME / 0 drift; `sync-check ../presacademy` 19 SAME / 0 drift.

**Why the cross-check does not list the new files, and what to do about it.**
`sync-check` walks the SITE repo for the marker, and presacademy's copies of
these fourteen do not carry it yet - that repo's session marked 19 other files
and stopped there. So the new cards are invisible to the cross-check until
presacademy adds the marker line, which is the first act of its next sync
session. Byte-identity was verified by hand in the meantime (each starter copy
diffed against presacademy's with the marker line stripped: identical, all
fourteen), so the moment the marker lands they report SAME with no reconciliation
needed.

**One deliberate oddity to leave alone.** `LIVE_DRAFT_MESSAGE` is `'pa:live-draft'`
in the canonical file and will stay that way everywhere. It is an arbitrary token
whose only job is to match at both ends of one repo's postMessage channel;
renaming it per repo would fork an otherwise identical file for nothing.

### 2026-08-28: card 28 canonicalized here, minus the band card

The floating in-canvas layer, brought from presacademy and cross-read against
WCP's independent port. Two working implementations of the same idea on two
different vocabularies is what made the generic/per-repo line easy to draw:
whatever the two agreed on down to the prose was portable, whatever they spelled
differently was the repo talking.

**Marked PORTABLE (6 files + 2 suites):** `src/lib/sanity-path.ts`,
`src/lib/inline-rich-write.ts` and both `.test.ts`; the word-picker half of
`src/lib/heading-accent.ts` (already canonical, extended in place);
`src/components/preview/overlay/usePopover.ts`, `overlay/useDraftDocument.ts`,
`overlay/styles.ts`.

**Left per-repo, unmarked:** `src/lib/section-fields.ts` + its drift gate (the
registry IS the vocabulary), `overlay/index.ts` (the control map),
`overlay/tool-theme.ts` (six brand values), and the two card components. The card
says which seam a later fold-back would cut.

**Two files were genericized on the way in, and neither repo's copy is the one
that landed.** `sanity-path.ts`'s `readSectionPath` now takes the page-builder
array names instead of owning them, and `styles.ts` reads its palette from the
new per-repo `tool-theme.ts` instead of declaring it inline. Both are the card-22
`redirects.ts` move: keep the arithmetic, hand the vocabulary in. presacademy and
WCP will both report DRIFT on these two the moment they mark their copies, and
the resolution is to take the starter's shape, not to fold the constants back.

**What the starter's own doctrine ruled out.** No band card, no surface control,
no tone field: `CLAUDE.md` #9 and card 26 both say a block here carries no colour
field, and `SectionRenderer` owns the cadence precisely so reordering cannot break
the rhythm. That is recorded on the card as the correct outcome rather than a gap,
and `section-fields.test.ts` now ASSERTS the absence, so the doctrine is a test
instead of a promise. The band-card styles still ship in the canonical
`styles.ts`, unused and tree-shaken, for the next repo.

**Vocabulary discovered here:** `headingAccent` on five types (`richTextSection`
matched against `heading`; `ctaBandSection`, `servicesGridSection`,
`testimonialsSection` and `faqSection` against `headline`), six `subhead` /
`subheadRich` twins (the four above minus `richTextSection`, plus `teamSection`
and `dynamicListSection`), and the two document-level hero strings
`heroHeadline` / `heroSubhead`, which only the bespoke pages render.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` 46 errors before and 46 after, all
pre-existing and environmental; `npm test` 359 -> 417, 0 fail (58 new: 14 for
`sanity-path`, 19 for `inline-rich-write`, 17 in the new `section-fields` drift
gate, and 8 for the word picker); `npm run lint` back to its pre-existing 1 error + 7
warnings, none in touched files; prettier clean on every touched file;
`npm run build` clean; `page-parity compare` **10/10** (this whole layer is
preview-only, so any parity movement would have been a bug); `sync-check`
self-check 44 -> **51 SAME / 0 drift**; `sync-check ../presacademy` **33 SAME /
0 drift**.

**One drift introduced, deliberately.** `sync-check ../ncs-church-starter` now
reports **42 SAME / 1 drifted**: `src/lib/heading-accent.ts`, because the word
picker was added to the canonical copy and church's copy ends where the file used
to. It is a pure append — the diff is "site: (end of file)" at line 78 — so the
resolution is to pull the starter's copy forward at church's next sync session,
which is also the session where church gets all three controls (it has the full
card-26 vocabulary, including the surfaces a band card needs). No church file was
touched here.

**Bundle.** The preview island (`VisualEditingOverlay`) went 10,679 -> 25,426
bytes raw, 9,546 gzipped. It is loaded `client:only` and only when draft mode is
on, so no public visitor ever downloads it; the public pages are byte-identical,
which is what the parity run proves.

**What no test can reach without a Studio open**, and what is now in
`docs/PENDING.md`: the resolver actually mounting on a heading, the picker writing
through the comlink into the draft, the paste allow-list against a real Word
paste, and the "Edit here" card's blur-saves behaviour. This template has no Sanity
project, so card 28 is proven here only as far as the build and the pure logic go.

### 2026-08-28: presacademy and WCP reconciled onto card 28 (card 28b)

The pass card 28b describes, run as one session over four repos. Nothing was
committed or pushed in any of them.

**Starter (library of record).** `src/lib/inline-rich.ts` gained `RUN_BREAK`;
`src/lib/inline-rich-write.ts` gained the `multiline` seam, `textToRuns`, a
whitespace squeeze in `pushText`, and a line-aware `normalizeRuns` that keeps the
card 28a boundary fix; `inline-rich-write.test.ts` gained 7 cases. `npm test`
418 -> 425, 0 fail. `tsc` 46 errors before and after, none in touched files. The
four files reid-design-site and mas-monograms carry (`styles.ts`, `usePopover.ts`,
`useDraftDocument.ts`, `sanity-path.ts`) were deliberately NOT touched, so neither
repo moved.

**ncs-church-starter.** Took the three changed canonical files as a straight copy.
`npm test` 449, 0 fail; `sync-check` **50 SAME / 0 drift**, unchanged. (Its `tsc`
has pre-existing `insertMenu.groups` readonly errors in the schema, untouched
here.)

**presacademy.** Took nine canonical files, gained
`overlay/tool-theme.ts`, and moved `SECTION_ARRAY_FIELDS` from `sanity-path.ts`
into `section-fields.ts` (three call sites updated: `section-fields.ts` x2,
`HeadingAccentPicker.tsx`, `SurfaceChips.tsx`). `sync-check` **33 -> 42 SAME /
0 drift**.

**WCP.** Same nine minus the two test files (vitest, see card 28b), plus the
`emphasis-write.ts` -> `inline-rich-write.ts` rename, the new
`src/lib/inline-rich.ts` adapter and the new `overlay/tool-theme.ts`. `sync-check`
**16 -> 21 marked, 19 SAME / 2 drifted** - the two drifts are the pre-existing,
self-documenting ones in `UndoRedo.tsx` and `shareDraftLink.tsx` and are expected.

**All five siblings after the pass:** presacademy 42/0/0, WCP 19/2/0 (both drifts
expected), ncs-church-starter 50/0/0, reid-design-site 17/0/0, mas-monograms
25/0/0.

## Card 30: One branch vocabulary across the family (2026-08-29)

Six repos had four conventions between them: this one still on `master`,
presacademy on `main` + `staging`, wcp and church-starter on `main` alone, and
reid + mas on `main` + a `modern-stack` holding branch. Every repo is now
`main` (production) + `staging` (edge preview), and nothing else.

**The renames went through GitHub's rename API, not delete-and-recreate.** That
API moves open PRs, retargets branch protection, and leaves a redirect for the
old name, so an old clone or a stale bookmark still resolves instead of 404ing.
Locally: `git branch -m`, `fetch --prune`, `branch -u`, and for this repo
`remote set-head origin -a` so `origin/HEAD` follows.

- ncs-astro-sanity-starter `master` -> `main` (default branch too)
- reid-design-site `modern-stack` -> `staging`
- mas-monograms `modern-stack` -> `staging`

`staging` is not decoration - it is a deploy target. presacademy's
`deploy-staging.yml` is now in all six, pointed at a `<worker>-staging` Worker
so production is never touched, and gated on `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` so it warns
and skips rather than failing where the secret is absent (same dormant-commit
pattern as `uptime.yml`). Worker names: `ncs-astro-sanity-starter-staging`,
`presacademy-staging`, `wcp-website-staging`, `church-starter-staging`,
`reid-design-site-staging`, `mas-monograms-staging`.

**A bug in the file being ported, found on the way out.** presacademy's
`deploy-staging.yml` ran `wrangler deploy --name presacademy-staging` - a PLAIN
deploy, which reads the source `wrangler.jsonc` and knows nothing about the
adapter's generated asset manifest, so every sub-route 404s on these hybrid
static+SSR builds. That is the same trap every repo's `npm run deploy` already
avoids with `-c dist/server/wrangler.json`, and card 18's own note warns about
it for the Workers Builds dashboard command. Fixed in presacademy and never
copied: all six now run `deploy -c dist/server/wrangler.json --name <worker>`.
The preview had presumably never been exercised, or this would have surfaced as
a staging site whose home page worked and whose every other page did not.

Every `ci.yml` push trigger is now `[main, staging]`. Two of these repos gained
CI on the branch they were actually working on: reid and mas only ever built on
`main`, so every `modern-stack` push - including the card 28 one - ran no CI at
all.

**Still human-side for reid and mas:** both auto-deploy from `main` through
Cloudflare Workers Builds, and card 18's activation note still stands. Check
each project's Workers Builds branch configuration after this rename - if it
names branches explicitly, `modern-stack` no longer exists under that name.

## Card 31: Studio welcome tour (2026-08-31)

**Dated 2026-08-30 (WCP), ported to presacademy 2026-08-31. Canonical copy: not
in the starter yet — WCP's `src/sanity/components/StudioTour.tsx` is the
reference.**

A first-visit stepped welcome dialog for the Studio, the same pattern as WCP's
hub tour: mounted by the custom `studio.components.layout` wrapper every repo
in this family already has (it loads the brand fonts), shown once per browser
via a versioned localStorage key, and replayable from the Welcome pane via a
CustomEvent. Every storage read is try/caught so a blocked localStorage (a
thumbnail renderer, a locked-down browser) can never take the Studio down.

Why it exists: these Studios are handed to non-technical volunteer editors,
and the first session decides whether they trust the tool. The tour's steps
teach the five things every editor needs on day one — nothing is live until
Publish, click the page to edit it, the ＋ starters, the Media library, and
where help lives.

**Adapt per site:** the step list (name the site's own tools and guide by
their real titles), the SEEN_KEY prefix, and (multi-workspace Studios only,
like WCP) workspace-aware middle steps via `useWorkspace()`. Bump SEEN_KEY
whenever the steps change enough that returning editors should see them again.

---

## Card 32: Branded tool headings (2026-08-31)

**Dated 2026-08-30 (WCP), ported to presacademy 2026-08-31. Canonical copy:
not in the starter yet — each site adapts its own logo.**

One `ToolHeading` component — the site's mark beside a display-font heading —
opens every custom Studio tool (Welcome, Checkup, setup wizard, stats, export,
cleanup). Before it, each tool hand-rolled a plain `<Heading>`, so the tools
read as unrelated white panels; after it, they read as one family, and a new
tool gets the brand moment for free by importing the component.

**Adapt per site:** the mark asset and any chip/backing the mark needs for
contrast (presacademy reuses StudioLogo's paper chip; WCP uses the sun+cloud
emblem with a display-font class).

---

## Card 33: Year-scoped lists for accumulating types (2026-08-31)

**Dated 2026-08-31 (WCP), ported to presacademy 2026-08-31. Canonical copy:
not in the starter yet — WCP's `yearScopedList` in `src/sanity/structure.ts`
is the reference (presacademy carries the single-type `yearScopedEvents`).**

Types that accumulate forever (updates, events, sign-up sheets, celebrations,
news, newsletters, hours ledgers) become unusable flat lists by year three: an
editor scrolls past a hundred dead rows to find this week's. The structure
helper opens such a type as "This school year (YYYY–YY)" — the default pane —
plus one pane per past year and an Everything list at the bottom. Presentation
only: nothing moves or archives. School years run Aug 1 – Jul 31, named by
their fall. Undated documents need a deliberate choice per type: content that
was WRITTEN at a moment (updates, posts) falls back to `_createdAt`; an
undated EVENT is an ongoing one ("Monthly info session") and belongs in EVERY
year pane — bucketing it by creation date empties the default view once the
creation year's pane ages out (bit presacademy 2026-08-31).

Two invariants: the folder's `.id()` must equal the old flat list's id so
guide links and bookmarks keep landing; and on a repo with soft-delete
(`archived`), every pane's filter must carry NOT_ARCHIVED or archived rows
resurface only in the year panes.

**Adapt per site:** the type list and each type's date field, the
FIRST_CONTENT_YEAR floor, and the school-year boundary if the client's year
is not Aug–Jul.

---

## Card 34: Studio search weights (2026-08-31)

**Dated 2026-08-31 (WCP), ported to presacademy 2026-08-31. Canonical: a
pattern, not a file.**

`__experimental_search` on the content document types, weighting the fields
editors actually see — title 5, hero headline / display heading 4, summary or
SEO description 2 (and `name` 5 / `question` 5 on people/FAQ types). Without
it the Studio's 🔍 matches internal titles only, and an editor searching the
words on a page finds nothing. Two lines per type; add them whenever a new
content type lands.

**Adapt per site:** the field paths per type (page hero fields differ per
repo — and remember which repos use Sanity's slug TYPE vs plain strings; see
the d209b1d drift gate).

---

## Card 35: The family test standard (2026-09-06)

**Dated 2026-09-06. Every Astro site in the studio runs the same quality gates.
WCP was the reference implementation; presacademy, reid-design-site,
mas-monograms, 2ndpreschicago and nixoncreativestudio were brought up to it on
2026-09-06, and this starter on the same day. Canonical copies live here.**

Card 8 was the Playwright half of this. Card 35 is the whole thing, because the
suites are only as good as the gates around them: `astro check` had never run on
several of these repos and found 242 real type errors on presacademy, 222 here,
19 on reid, 16 on mas and 13 on 2nd Pres, including two sites whose Studio logo
rendered `src="[object Object]"` in production.

**The gates.** `ci.yml`, on push to `main` and `staging` plus every PR, two
parallel jobs:

- **build**: `npm ci`, Sanity typegen with a three-attempt retry loop (runner
  flake, see card 5), the stale-types guard, `npx astro check`, `npm run lint`,
  `npm run format:check`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run build`,
  `npm run check:links`.
- **test**: `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium webkit`, then the
  suites, with `playwright-report/` uploaded as an artifact for 14 days.

`lighthouse.yml` is a SEPARATE workflow, not a step inside CI, so a slow audit
never delays the build verdict and a repo can re-run it alone.
`lighthouserc.json` carries an EXPLICIT `url` list: with `staticDistDir` alone
lhci auto-discovers pages and caps at five, so it audits a near-random subset.
Accessibility is a hard gate at 1.0, LCP 4500ms and CLS 0.1 are hard,
performance / SEO / best-practices are warnings so ordinary CI variance does not
block a PR.

**The suites**, in `tests/`: `smoke` (every route 200s and carries the site name
in its title), `a11y` (axe, light, zero violations), `a11y-dark` (axe again
after forcing the theme, plus a focus-indicator check), `reflow` (no horizontal
overflow at 320, 768, 1024, 1440). Chromium runs everything; a real WebKit
iPhone 14 profile runs smoke and both axe sweeps. Visual regression is
deliberately NOT part of this: it belongs only where a site has a fixture-driven
`/styleguide` route with fixed data (WCP, presacademy). Screenshotting
CMS-driven pages flakes with content.

**Five things this standard exists to stop, each one a real incident:**

- **The linkinator skip pattern.** WCP's `--skip "^(?!http://localhost)"`
  matched linkinator's own 127.0.0.1 seed, so every green CI run for months had
  scanned ZERO links. The correct pattern is
  `^https?://(?!(localhost|127[.]0[.]0[.]1)[:/])`, and the check is to read the
  log: it must say "scanned N links" with N greater than zero. On this repo the
  first honest run found 135 broken internal links across ten pages.
- **A prettier pass can silently eat a meaningful space** in an Astro template,
  and `prettier-plugin-astro` cannot parse a `<script>` nested inside a template
  expression at all (it reads the script body's braces as expression delimiters
  and throws). Ignore those files or move the script into its own component, and
  diff the built HTML TEXT before and after the format commit. This repo has
  `npm run parity` for exactly that; elsewhere, do it by hand.
- **A Tailwind `focus:ring` is a box-shadow**, and WebKit renders native form
  controls itself and DROPS box-shadow on them. A `<select>` carrying
  `focus:outline-none` plus a ring has no focus indicator at all on Safari and
  iOS while Chromium looks perfect. Selects need `outline`. Six of them here.
- **A WebM-first `<video>` never fires `load` in WebKit.** Navigate with
  `waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'`; with `'load'` the run hangs until the test
  times out and the report says nothing useful.
- **axe has no rule for focus-indicator contrast**, and an axe sweep only ever
  audits the resting DOM. That blind spot is how WCP shipped eight forms whose
  dark-mode focus ring measured 1.13:1, on a green build with Lighthouse at 100.
  `a11y-dark.spec.ts` asserts the indicator EXISTS; `theme-tokens.test.ts` pins
  its contrast.

**What is canonical here and what is not.** Marked `PORTABLE` and byte-exact
across the family: `playwright.config.ts`, `tests/helpers.ts`,
`tests/smoke.spec.ts`, `tests/a11y.spec.ts`, `tests/a11y-dark.spec.ts`,
`tests/reflow.spec.ts`. Every per-site list was pushed OUT of them into
`tests/routes.ts`, which is the seam: the route list, the hidden-route list, and
`FORM_ROUTES`. `smoke.spec.ts` reads the title from `src/data/site.ts` rather
than a literal, so `npm run apply-brand` cannot leave it asserting the previous
project's name.

Deliberately NOT marked, and the reason matters: `ci.yml` and `lighthouse.yml`
carry a per-site `env:` block of PUBLIC_SANITY_\* identifiers, and
`lighthouserc.json` carries a per-site `url` list, so a byte-exact drift check
would fail forever on every repo and teach everyone to ignore it. Copy their
SHAPE; the parts that must not diverge are ci.yml's step list, its concurrency
group, the linkinator skip, and lighthouserc.json's `assert` block. `.prettierrc`
is identical family-wide but is plain JSON with no comment syntax, so it cannot
carry a first-line marker; `.prettierignore` is legitimately per-site (each repo
ignores a different set of unparseable templates). Two of this repo's own
PORTABLE scripts, `sync-check.mjs` and `page-parity.mjs`, were listed in
`.prettierignore` here, because formatting them would rewrite their quoting and
put sibling repos into DRIFT on the next check. That family-wide pass happened
on 2026-09-06: see card 36. They are formatted and no longer ignored anywhere.

**Adapt per site:** `tests/routes.ts` (derive from `src/pages` and check each
path against the built `dist/client`), the `url` list in `lighthouserc.json`,
the `env:` blocks, the reveal selectors in `tests/helpers.ts` if a site's polish
layer gates on something else, and whether `a11y-dark` applies at all (a site
with no dark theme skips it). The Playwright port is 4321 by default and
overridable with `PLAYWRIGHT_PORT`, so a run can share a machine with a dev
server or another repo's suite.

---

## Card 36: sync-check as a CI gate (2026-09-06)

**Dated 2026-09-06. `scripts/sync-check.mjs` runs in every repo's `ci.yml`
instead of only ever by hand. Two canonical scripts were formatted family-wide
in the same pass so prettier can never reopen a drift. wcp got its first copy
of the script at all.**

Card 28 gave the family a drift check. It found drift months late, because
nothing ran it. The gate is five lines of YAML in the build job, after the
install step, and needs no token: all of these repos are public.

```yaml
- name: Check out the library of record
  uses: actions/checkout@v7
  with:
    repository: NateJ45/ncs-astro-sanity-starter
    ref: ${{ github.ref_name == 'staging' && 'staging' || 'main' }}
    path: .ncs-starter

- name: Canonical files have not drifted
  env:
    NCS_STARTER_DIR: ${{ github.workspace }}/.ncs-starter
  run: |
    node scripts/sync-check.mjs
    rm -rf "$NCS_STARTER_DIR"
```

**The `rm -rf` is not tidiness, it is required.** `actions/checkout` refuses a
path outside the workspace, so the library lands INSIDE the repo, and every
whole-tree tool further down the build job then sweeps it. mas-monograms found
this within a minute of the first push: `prettier --check .` tried to format
the library's `astro.config.mjs` using mas's node_modules and died resolving
`@fontsource/libre-baskerville`. `eslint .` (presacademy, reid-design-site)
would have done the same. Deleting the checkout the moment the check passes
beats adding `.ncs-starter` to a `.prettierignore`, a `.gitignore` and an
eslint config in six repos, because that list has to be remembered again for
the next whole-tree tool anyone adds. Same reasoning as dropping the
`.prettierignore` entries above: prefer the fix that cannot be forgotten.

The walker skips `.ncs-starter` by name as well. That is belt and braces on
purpose: the skip covers a LOCAL run against a checkout someone left in place,
the `rm -rf` covers the rest of the CI job.

The starter itself runs the SELF-CHECK form instead: no second checkout, just
`node scripts/sync-check.mjs`, which resolves the library to this repo root.

**The `ref:` line is load-bearing, and it was not in the original sketch.** A
staging build checks against the starter's `staging`; a main build, and any PR,
against its `main`. Without it the family's two-branch promotion model cannot
stage a canonical change AT ALL: this very card is the proof, because the six
sites were made to match a starter whose fix existed only on staging, so every
site's staging run would have failed against the starter's main for a reason
nobody could act on. It also makes the PROMOTION ORDER load-bearing:

> Promote the starter to main FIRST, then the sites. A site on main checks
> against the starter on main, so a site promoted ahead of the starter goes red
> until the starter catches up.

That ordering is a real cost of the gate and worth saying out loud rather than
discovering it on a red main.

**The prettier conflict, and why the ignore lost.** `sync-check.mjs` writes
`'the site\'s improvement'`; prettier's `singleQuote` rule prefers whichever
quote needs fewer escapes and rewrites it to `"the site's improvement"`. The
same is true of `page-parity.mjs`, plus four over-long template literals it
would rewrap. The old defence was to list both files in the starter's
`.prettierignore`. It did not work, and could not:

- The ignore entries were never propagated. As of 2026-09-06 the starter and
  2ndpreschicago ignored both, reid-design-site and nixoncreativestudio ignored
  only `sync-check.mjs`, and wcp, presacademy and mas-monograms ignored
  neither. So a `prettier --write` during the card 35 rollout reformatted
  presacademy's and mas-monograms' copies, and the check went red in exactly
  the repos the ignore was supposed to protect.
- An ignore is a standing obligation on seven files nobody reads. Formatting is
  a one-time cost with a fixed point: once the canonical bytes ARE prettier's
  output, `prettier --write` is a no-op forever and `format:check` becomes a
  SECOND guard on the canonical text rather than a threat to it.

So both files were formatted here, dropped from every `.prettierignore` that
listed them, and the formatted bytes were copied into all six site repos in the
same pass. The change is quoting and line wrapping only; no behaviour changed.
Do not re-add the ignore lines.

**Two things the pass turned up.**

- `scripts/page-parity.mjs` is marked `PORTABLE` HERE but carries no marker in
  any of the six site repos, so sync-check has never checked it anywhere. The
  starter's `.prettierignore` comment claimed it was "carried BYTE-EXACT by
  reid-design-site, mas-monograms and presacademy"; it is not. Card 3 says the
  harness is shared, and the matrix says `yes` for every repo, but the file has
  genuinely diverged (each site has its own PAGES list) and is a fork in
  practice. Either mark it and reconcile, or write the fork down. Left alone
  here on purpose: it is a bigger decision than a formatting pass.
- nixoncreativestudio and 2ndpreschicago were not carrying a quoting drift at
  all. Their `sync-check.mjs` predated card 28a's NESTED-APP RULE (2026-08-28),
  the one that lets wcp's `site/scripts/foo.mjs` match the starter's
  `scripts/foo.mjs`. They took the current copy forward.

**wcp.** The repo the whole family copied from had no `scripts/sync-check.mjs`,
so it was the one repo that could not say when it had drifted. It now carries
the canonical copy at `site/scripts/sync-check.mjs`, next to its siblings, and
the NESTED-APP RULE is what makes the nested path resolve. Its first run ever
checked 22 marked files and found three drifts, all three real:

- **`src/lib/preview-morph.ts` had a fix nobody else had.** wcp added a
  KEEP-AS-IS SUBTREE guard on 2026-08-30: an element carrying `data-morph-keep`
  is not morphed, because a `server:defer` island streams its real body through
  inline scripts that a `DOMParser` parse never runs, so the FETCHED tree still
  holds the fallback skeleton and morphing it in swapped a live widget for its
  skeleton on every soft refresh. That is the hub preview's "widgets disappear"
  bug. Ported UP into the canonical copy here and out to presacademy,
  reid-design-site and mas-monograms. It is inert where the attribute is never
  set: the guard requires it on BOTH trees. Card 29c's file, so no new row.
- **`src/sanity/components/UndoRedo.tsx` and
  `src/sanity/components/shareDraftLink.tsx` are a genuine fork**, and the
  MARKER WAS DROPPED in wcp rather than either copy being changed. wcp resolves
  `@sanity/icons` 5.2.1 (transitively, it has no direct dependency); the starter
  and every other site pin 3.8.0. The 5.x barrel stopped re-exporting each icon,
  so wcp imports `@sanity/icons/Undo` where the canonical copy imports from the
  package root. Neither copy can adopt the other without breaking a build, so
  this is the case the drift rule reserves for dropping the marker and writing
  the fork down. Both files now carry a FORKED header saying what differs, why,
  and what to do when the starter moves to icons 5: re-mark and take the
  starter's copy. Nothing else in either file differs.

wcp's remaining 20 marked files were already byte-exact, which is the useful
half of the result: the drift that had accumulated in the repo nobody could
check was three files, and two of them were a dependency-version fork rather
than rot.

**Also folded in:** `ncs-church-starter` was archived on 2026-09-06, so the
header comment in `sync-check.mjs` (canonical, hence one edit here that
propagates), this repo's `CLAUDE.md` and 2ndpreschicago's README stopped
describing it as a live peer. PORTS.md keeps its column and its historical
cards: those are a record of what happened, not a claim about today.

**Adapt per site:** nothing, except wcp, whose workflows sit at the repo root
while the app lives in `site/`. Its build job already sets
`defaults.run.working-directory: site`, so the `run:` line is unchanged, but the
checkout `path:` and `NCS_STARTER_DIR` are both relative to
`github.workspace` (the repo root), NOT to `site/`. Put the starter checkout at
`.ncs-starter` at the root and point `NCS_STARTER_DIR` at it there.

## 37. Drift opens its own pull request (2026-09-06)

`sync-check` detects drift and stops the build, but porting the improvement
up was still an errand you had to remember to start, in another repo, after
the build that blocked you. `scripts/propose-drift.mjs` closes that: when the
check fails in a site, CI copies that site's version of the drifted files into
a `sync/from-<site>` branch here and opens a PR.

It deliberately does **not** merge. Whether a change belongs in the library
every future project inherits is a judgement, not a diff, and the same file
can legitimately be an improvement in one site and a fork in another.

The cost of not having it: wcp-website's `preview-morph.ts` carried a
`data-morph-keep` fix that the other five repos lacked for roughly three
months, and it only surfaced because a sync session happened to look.

Needs `GH_ACTIONS_PAT` with write access to THIS repo, not only to the site
repos. Without it the step warns and the build still fails on sync-check, so
the gate never depends on the automation working.

### The push needs `-c http.<host>.extraheader=`, and this card was wrong without it

This card described a working mechanism for several hours before one existed.
Written is not verified: the step was wired into six repos, all of them green,
and it had never once opened a PR.

The acceptance test that settled it (mas-monograms#36): drift a canonical file
on purpose, push it, and watch for a PR appearing HERE that nobody started.
Anything weaker tests that the code is present, not that it works.

Attempts one and two failed identically:

```
remote: Permission to NateJ45/ncs-astro-sanity-starter.git denied to github-actions[bot].
fatal: ... The requested URL returned error: 403
```

which reads exactly like a missing or wrong `GH_ACTIONS_PAT` and is not that.
The PAT was present and correct throughout and was never consulted. The push
needs `-c http.https://github.com/.extraheader=`: an empty extraheader sends no
header, and `-c` overrides every config scope for that one command.

Resist the obvious explanation. "actions/checkout persisted its credentials
into the clone" is wrong, and attempt two was built on it: unsetting the key at
`--local` scope fixed nothing, because the run that finally worked printed
`persisted credential keys: (none)`. The header comes from a scope `--local`
does not list. That one print is the only reason the false diagnosis died
instead of shipping with a confident comment explaining it.

Two lessons, both earned the expensive way:

- A step that exits 0 so it cannot mask the real failure equally cannot report
  its own. Give it diagnostics or its breakage is silent forever.
- When a fix is reasoned rather than observed, test the mechanism directly
  before spending a CI round trip. The precedence question here took about a
  minute locally with a deliberately bogus header: the push fails without the
  override and succeeds with it.

## 38. presacademy harvest audit, and eleven files that were already the same (2026-09-06)

The second harvest audit of the family (WCP was card 35's neighbour) went
through `src/lib/**` and `scripts/**` in presacademy. presacademy is the
ANCESTOR of most of this library, so the expectation going in was byte drift
on files the starter had generalised after copying them. What it actually
found was that the drift is almost entirely legitimate: the two repos have
different singleton sets, different brand colours and a different section
model, and the files that carry any of those cannot be byte-identical.

Eleven files were already identical and are now marked in both repos:

    scripts/generate-llms-full.mjs
    src/lib/phone.ts
    src/lib/portable-text-headings.ts
    src/lib/reading-time.ts
    src/lib/scriptAccent.ts
    src/lib/slugify.ts
    src/lib/slugify.test.ts
    src/lib/subscribe.ts
    src/lib/utils.ts
    src/lib/utils.test.ts

plus `scripts/lib/loadEnv.mjs`, which was already marked here and merely
lacked the header in presacademy.

Two of those needed a change first, and both went UP.

**`scripts/generate-llms-full.mjs`.** presacademy still carried its own
inlined `loadEnv()`, an eleven-line copy predating `scripts/lib/loadEnv.mjs`.
The shared loader is strictly better: it strips inline `#` comments outside
quotes, takes quoted values literally, and tolerates leading whitespace on the
key. presacademy now imports it, which is what made the file identical.

**`src/lib/utils.test.ts`.** The library's copy named three tests wrong. When
the empty-array case was corrected from "returns 0" to "returns 1", the two
neighbouring cases were renamed with it, so the library shipped
`test('returns 1 for null/undefined input')` asserting `0`, and the same for
non-array input. presacademy had two of the three right. The names now say
what each branch does, with a comment recording WHY the branches disagree:
`readingTimeFromPortableText` floors an ARRAY at one minute, and returns a
bare `0` for anything that is not an array so the caller can hide the label.
Nothing about the assertions changed; the test file was lying about itself.

DELIBERATELY NOT MARKED, with the reason, because a marker is a promise to
keep two files byte-identical forever and an unactionable red check is how a
checker gets ignored:

- `src/lib/nav-href.ts` - the singleton-to-route table is per-site by
  definition. The starter also has an `pageArchived` guard presacademy has
  no `archived` field to use.
- `src/lib/preview-auth.ts` - identical but for the `VERSION` namespace
  constant, which is deliberately per-site so a shared token yields a
  different cookie fingerprint on each. The file's own comment says
  "rename this on a fork".
- `src/lib/sanity.ts`, `queries.ts`, `schemas.ts`, `siteSettings.ts`,
  `section-fields.ts`, `surfaces.ts`, `layout-variants.ts`,
  `sectionVisibility.ts` - all carry the site's own document types,
  section list or token set.
- `scripts/lib/render-og.mjs`, `scripts/generate-og-*.mjs` - brand
  typography and layout.
- `scripts/generate-logo-variants.mjs`, `scripts/optimize-logo-files.mjs` -
  identical today, but both hard-code the brand ink hexes (`#3D3D3D`,
  `#F5F0EB`). Marking them would turn the first rebrand into a CI failure
  in a repo that did nothing wrong.
- `scripts/page-parity.mjs` - already carries a header explaining that it
  is a PATTERN, not a canonical file, and that the starter's copy is the
  parameterized descendant. That header is the convention working.

### Two places presacademy is still ahead, both blocked on a consumer here

**`sectionFieldEditAttr` (`src/lib/preview-edit-attr.ts`).** presacademy
exports a second attribute builder that targets a FIELD inside a section
(`pageBuilder[_key=="..."].background`) rather than the bare array item. The
distinction is load-bearing and was learned in a deployed Studio: the overlay
will outline a node whose attribute names an array item, which is what gives
the section its insert/duplicate/drag menu, but a custom overlay COMPONENT
only mounts on a node the Studio schema resolves to a FIELD. An array item is
not one, so `getField` returns nothing and the component resolver is never
called. That is the whole reason presacademy's in-canvas background swatch
row can get on screen. The library has no in-canvas field control yet, so it
has nowhere to put the function; port it the day it grows one.

**Vertical centring in `scripts/lib/render-og.mjs`.** The library composites
the wordmark at `top: 200`, the rule at `y: 330` and the first tagline line at
`top: 360`, all fixed. presacademy measures the rendered wordmark and tagline,
sums the group height and centres it, so a card with one tagline line and a
card with three are both balanced. The library's numbers are tuned for two
lines and only for two. The port is real but not a copy: presacademy's version
is entangled with its three-part wordmark ("The Presbyterian / Academy",
keyword in green), so adopting it means separating the centring math from the
wordmark parsing first.

## 39. The restore drill, and an off-site copy of the backup (2026-09-06)

`sanity-backup.yml` had been green nightly on all five Sanity sites for months
(presacademy alone: 33 successful runs, a 28.8 MB encrypted tarball). Nobody
had ever restored one. Those runs prove the export and encrypt steps work and
say nothing about whether a client's content can be recovered, which is the
only property the backup exists for. Same shape as card 37 and as the link
checker that scanned nothing: green means no test failed, not that a test would
have failed.

Two things close it.

**`scripts/restore-dataset.mjs`** does decrypt, import and a document count in
one command. The count is the point: a restore that imports 0 documents exits 0
just as loudly as one that imports 4,000, so the script prints what it ended up
with and tells you to compare it against production. It refuses to target
`production` without `--i-understand-this-overwrites-production` - no short
form, no env var - because the realistic disaster is not a corrupt tarball, it
is someone restoring three-week-old content over a live site at 9pm while
fixing something smaller. It deletes the decrypted plaintext afterwards, since
an unencrypted dataset in a working copy is the leak the workflow's encrypt
step exists to prevent.

It resolves the CLI as `sanity.cmd` on win32. The workflow can hardcode
`./node_modules/.bin/sanity` because it only runs on Ubuntu; this script runs on
whoever's laptop, and a restore is not the moment to discover that path does not
exist on Windows.

**An R2 copy in the workflow.** Actions artifacts expire at 90 days and live in
the same GitHub account as the repo they protect, so one lost account loses the
site and its backups together. The step reuses `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, which every site already has - but the token needs
"Workers R2 Storage: Edit" added, and a deploy-only token will 403. Gated on a
`BACKUP_R2_BUCKET` variable and skips with a warning when unset: a missing
off-site copy must never fail a backup that is otherwise working. Keyed by repo
and date so one bucket holds the family and no upload overwrites an earlier
good copy.

**What the first real drill found (2026-09-07, wcp-website).** The drill passed
— 370 documents restored against production's 371, the one difference being
`_.schemas.wcp`, a system document Sanity's export excludes by design — but it
could not be run as written, and three separate things had to be fixed first.
Every one of them was an instruction that had been committed and never
executed:

- **The passphrase was unrecoverable.** `docs/SANITY.md` told you to create it
  with `openssl rand -base64 32 | gh secret set BACKUP_PASSPHRASE ...`, then
  added "(store the value before piping it away)" — which that command makes
  impossible. GitHub never shows a secret again. Every encrypted backup since
  the secret was set was undecryptable: green runs, a proper `Salted__`
  tarball, an off-site copy, and nothing openable. Generate and READ it, save
  it, then set it — two steps, never one.
- **The off-site step was truncated.** The `for` loop had no closing `done` in
  all five ported repos, while the starter's copy was correct. It passed only
  because the guard's `exit 0` ran before bash reached the malformed loop; the
  moment `BACKUP_R2_BUCKET` was set it died with "syntax error: unexpected end
  of file". Following this card's own instruction would have turned five green
  backups red.
- **The token lookup and `--create` were both wrong for a real repo.** The
  script checked `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN` and `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN`;
  wcp-website's `.dev.vars` uses `SANITY_TOKEN` and nothing else, so the drill
  stopped with "No write token found" while a valid write token sat in the
  file. And `--create` cannot work with any content token: creating a dataset
  needs the project-admin grant `sanity.project.datasets/create`. Create the
  scratch dataset under your own CLI login (`npx sanity dataset create
restore-drill -p <projectId>` — `-p`, not `--project`, which prints the whole
  help text and reads like a different error), then run without `--create`.

The lesson is the card's own thesis turned on the card: writing the drill is
not running it, and a script that has never been run is a backup that has never
been restored. Two sites (2ndpreschicago, mas-monograms) turned out to have no
backup at all — the export job skips without `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN` and reports
success.

`docs/RESTORE-DRILL.md` is the ten-minute exercise. Run it at launch and after
any change to the workflow, the CLI major version or the passphrase, then log
the date - an untested backup and one tested eleven months ago are different
things and only the log tells them apart.

### What the first real drill found (presacademy, 2026-09-06)

**The backup was fine. The script was not.** It took four attempts, and every
failure was in the recovery path rather than in the data - which is exactly the
part that had never been exercised. Each one would otherwise have landed during
an actual incident:

1. **It read only `process.env`.** The passphrase was in `.env` the whole time,
   where every other script in this family looks. Now uses `loadEnv`.
2. **It preferred `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN` over `SANITY_API_WRITE_TOKEN`.** A machine
   with both would have handed the import the backup's READ token and failed on
   permissions, looking exactly like a broken backup. Write wins now.
3. **It shelled out to `openssl`.** Fine on a runner; on Windows openssl usually
   exists only via Git's `mingw64\bin` and is often not on PATH. A recovery tool
   must not depend on a binary the recovering machine may lack, so the decrypt
   is now pure Node - verified byte-identical to openssl's output on a real
   27.5 MB backup (both produce 28,792,515 bytes).
4. **It spawned `node_modules/.bin/sanity.cmd`.** Since the fix for
   CVE-2024-27980 Node refuses to spawn a `.cmd` without `shell: true`, failing
   as a bare `EINVAL`. It now runs the CLI's own JS entry through
   `process.execPath`: no shell, and so no quoting question when `count(*)` is
   passed as an argument.
5. **It swallowed a failed `dataset create`,** so the import died later with
   "Dataset not found" and a twenty-line client stack trace pointing at the
   wrong thing entirely. It now verifies the dataset exists and names the real
   cause.

And a sixth, caught before it shipped: the check in (5) first called `die()`,
which uses `process.exit()` and therefore SKIPS the `finally` block. It would
have printed "the decrypted tarball has been removed" while leaving 28 MB of
client content in plaintext on disk - the error path reintroducing the very leak
the encrypt step exists to prevent. It throws now, and cleanup always runs.

Also learned: `sanity dataset create` needs a project-admin grant that a content
write token does not carry, so the scratch dataset is created by hand first.

Result: 112 documents restored against 113 in production, and the one difference
was `_.schemas.churchstarter`, a schema manifest rather than content. Established
by diffing the id sets, not by assuming a single missing document was drift.

## 40. The public-data audit: what can a stranger read? (2026-09-06)

Sanity's free plan is "2 datasets (public only)". A public dataset is readable
by anyone over a plain URL with no token, and the project id is not a secret -
it appears in every image URL in the page source (51 times on wcp-website's
homepage). `?query=*` needs no knowledge of the schema.

wcp-website had 37 family directory entries public: 40 children's names, 71
parents, 33 home addresses. The Family Hub gate in front of them is correctly
built - shared password reduced to a fingerprint in server-side KV, fails
closed, rotation logs everyone out. It protects the PAGE. The Content Lake API
is a second door and it was open.

The root cause was a written assumption. `src/sanity/env.ts` said "The dataset
is PRIVATE, so all reads happen server-side" - a comment, never checked, that
the whole design rested on. Nothing in the new-project checklist said a public
dataset is public, so nothing caught it for months.

`scripts/public-data-audit.mjs` queries each site's dataset **anonymously** -
the absence of a token is the whole point - and fails when personal data comes
back. `public-data-policy.json` holds the exceptions, each with a reason, so the
judgement is made once in daylight rather than against a red build at 9pm.

Three design decisions worth keeping:

- **It never prints values.** These repos are public, so the build log is as
  public as the dataset. A checker that pasted the exposed data into a world
  readable log would be a worse leak than the one it reports.
- **Personal field NAMES fail; personal-looking VALUES only notify.** An email
  in a privacy policy is deliberate publishing. Failing builds over it teaches
  everyone to add blanket allows, and then the check protects nothing.
- **It refuses to skip.** The first version could not find wcp-website's project
  id (hardcoded in src/sanity/env.ts, not an env var) and exited 0 with a pass
  over 37 exposed families. It now reads the source too, and a repo that depends
  on Sanity with no resolvable id FAILS rather than reporting a pass it did not
  earn. Same trap as cards 37 and 39: green means no test failed, not that a
  test would have failed.

Tuning that mattered: `children` is Portable Text's field name for spans AND a
nav submenu AND actual children, so it is flagged only when the contents look
like people. Verified in both directions - wcp-website fails on
`directoryEntry: 37 documents`, presacademy passes with its legal-page contact
emails correctly reported as notices rather than failures.
