description: Trigger a production rebuild so published Sanity content goes live
---

The site is statically built: Sanity publishes do NOT appear on the live site
until a rebuild runs (see docs/agent/deployment.md). This command triggers one.

1. Check for uncommitted work first: `git status -sb`. If the tree is dirty,
   stop and ask the user whether to commit those changes (a push would deploy
   them) or stash them. Never bundle unrelated dirty files into a rebuild.

2. If the tree is clean, trigger the rebuild with an empty commit:

   ```
   git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger production rebuild for published Sanity content"
   git push origin main
   ```

   Cloudflare detects the push and runs `npm run build` (which re-fetches all
   Sanity content at build time). Live in roughly 1 to 3 minutes.

3. Tell the user how to confirm: watch Cloudflare, Workers and Pages, then
   Deployments, or reload the changed page after about 3 minutes (hard refresh;
   the edge cache can serve stale HTML briefly).

Note: if rebuild-on-publish should be automatic, the durable fix is the
Sanity webhook connected to a Cloudflare deploy hook described in
docs/agent/deployment.md ("Sanity to live site rebuild model"). Offer to walk
the user through it if they are triggering manual rebuilds repeatedly.
